The observability should allow to capture on demand low level metrics at a very low overhead. The proposal is to use ebpf as the tracing technology to capture details at kernel and user level, and generate on demand flamegraphs, heat maps for applications &amp; backend services. The in-kernel BPF JIT compiler, bpf program verifier and in-kernel storage maps implementation allow users to run the programs in kernel that can never interfere with the kernel negatively, without much overhead. These features make eBPF programs safe to run in production, and allow admins and engineers to collect crucial data from systems for performance analysis and monitoring.

In this talk we will demonstrate a set of tools to better monitor performance and identify optimal configuration settings. We will demonstrate how Prometheus, a project that is now part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), can be applied to monitor and archive system performance data in a containerized spark environment. In our examples, we will gather spark metric output through Prometheus and present the data with Grafana dashboards. We will use our examples to demonstrate how performance can be enhanced through different tuned configuration settings. Our demo will show how to configure settings across the cluster as well as within each node.\n\nAbout Diane\nDiane Feddema is a principal software engineer at Red Hat Inc Canada, Emerging Technologies Group.

As a developer, you really want to be able to focus your time on creating new solutions. But as much as you might want to ignore it, you still have to ensure the apps you build scale, stay up and stay secure. Developers still need to understand and control the software supply chain: you still need to know who built what. You need to understand if your software is vulnerable, compliant with your processes and regulations, and secure. And you need to know what is running right now, where it is running, and to be able to control when it changes. So the trick is how to spend as little time as possible on these issues so you can focus on building your app. The combination of Kubernetes and Cloud can make that happen for you. At IBM we are focused on helping you focus. The IBM Cloud Container Service, which leverages Kubernetes, provides advanced capabilities for building cloud-native apps, adding DevOps to existing apps, and ultimately relieves the pain around security, scale, and infrastructure management.&nbsp;\n\nAbout Jason\nJason McGee, IBM Fellow, is VP and CTO of Container and Microservice Tribe. Jason leads the technical strategy and architecture across all of IBM Cloud, with specific focus on core foundational cloud services, including containers, micro-services, continuous delivery and operational visibility services.

(Any Skill Level)\n\nJoin SPIFFE and SPIRE contributors for an overview of the newest project to join the CNCF. Modern software development relies on many microservices working together, that in production may be distributed over different middleware systems, container schedulers, PaaS platforms and even different cloud providers. As production environments become more complex, and dynamic - establishing trust between microservices is becomes more difficult, creating challenges for developers, operations teams, and security teams alike. Enter SPIFFE (Secure Production Infrastructure for Everyone) and which builds on designs first championed at Google, Twitter and elsewhere to provide robust authentication and trust between disparate micro-services. SPIFFE and SPIRE make it trivial to establish trust between workloads that may be elastically scaled and dynamically scheduled, and deployed in deeply heterogenous environments. We'll walk through the design goals for SPIFFE (a specification) and SPIRE (a multi-cloud implementation of SPIFFE), an overview of SPIRE's modular architecture, and an overview of how it can be used in conjunction with other tools such as secret stores and service meshes to build secure and scalable microservice architectures.\n\nAbout Andrew\nAndrew is the co-founder of Scytale, who are helping bring SPIFFE into the world.

The observability should allow to capture on demand low level metrics at a very low overhead. The proposal is to use ebpf as the tracing technology to capture details at kernel and user level, and generate on demand flamegraphs, heat maps for applications &amp; backend services. The in-kernel BPF JIT compiler, bpf program verifier and in-kernel storage maps implementation allow users to run the programs in kernel that can never interfere with the kernel negatively, without much overhead. These features make eBPF programs safe to run in production, and allow admins and engineers to collect crucial data from systems for performance analysis and monitoring.

It is even harder on Kubernetes since the deployments are, rightfully so, safely guarded by the API Server of the cluster. Organizations tend to lockdown the API Server, restricting the ability to use an external CI tool. Using external CI tools thus comes at a cost of security, access, and ease-of-use. Nearmap dealt with these challenges using intrinsic Kubernetes principles. We use CircleCI, Amazon Web Service (AWS) Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and a custom Kubernetes controller to achieve a declarative configuration approach to continuous deployment. In this talk, we discuss the challenges faced, provide an in-depth analysis of our declarative CI/CD approach and how Nearmap is enabling self-managed continuous deployments of Kubernetes clusters.\n\nAbout Suneeta\nSuneeta Mall is a Senior Software Engineer at Nearmap – a leading provider of high resolution aerial imagery. She is leading the efforts of containerizing and migrating Nearmap services to Kubernetes (on Amazon Web Services) from Amazon’s Elastic Compute.

Then after a brief review of current tooling, Tanmai will propose an architecture for a DIY tooling setup that will allow developers to setup their own git-push based workflow for kubernetes. The talk will delve into step-by-step implementation detail and touch upon how git-hooks works. Vamshi will go into more detail regarding the pre-push and the pre-receive hooks. Tanmai will then wrap up with a demo (if possible/recorded), followed by links to boilerplates and resources for the attendees.\n\nAbout Tanmai\nTanmai runs a startup, Hasura, where they've built a PaaS on Kubernetes. They were early adopters in the container ecosystem (pre-1.0 adopters for both Docker and Kubernetes) and have grown and contributed to the ecosystem as a company especially in India. Before this, Tanmai ran a small and successful consulting and services agency where their work included everything from MVPs for startups to helping one of the largest banks in the world migrate from legacy monoliths to containerised microservices. Tanmai has been building applications for over 8 years now with a variety of frameworks. He is a firm advocate of democratising the power to develop applications and proudly teach the largest tech MOOC in India, imad.tech! Tanmai is a frequent speaker at conferences, events/meetups in India & Singapore. Most of his recent talks/presentations/demos have been around kubernetes. Some conferences he's been spotted speaking at include: ContainerConf, FunctionalConf, IEEE CCEM.\n\nAbout Vamshi \nVamshi heads engineering at Hasura. He was instrumental in leading Docker and Kubernetes adoption at Hasura and spotted its opportunity and utility to the dev-community in its nascent stages. Although Vamshi's Masters work was with JVM internals and compiler optimisations, he has since built expertise in the Haskell and kubernetes ecosystem. In fact, he was one of the first people in the community to write a Kubernetes operator (which now powers the Hasura platform). Vamshi's latest work at Hasura is setting up a declarative infrastructure provisioning system. Vamshi is an occasional speaker at niche meetups and conferences (FunctionalConf), especially his experiences and work with Haskell.\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona May 20 - 23, Shanghai June 24 - 26, and San Diego November 18 - 21!

However, transitioning from REST to gRPC has some pain points due to missing alternatives for commonly-used tools. Sending free-form JSON over cURL does not work. There is no integration with Swagger/OpenAPI. Polished alternatives to GUIs like Postman or Swagger UI don't exist. Providing a REST interface over the gRPC services can solve these problems. We present a brokerless solution, using a Protobuf compiler plugin to generate a library of RESTful controllers with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

This is the case in environments like CERN where its large internal computing infrastructure is usually big enough but where periods prior to big international conferences or large event reconstruction campaigns see a significant spike in the amount of workloads submitted. We will describe early experiences relying on Kubernetes federations to expand the available capacity to external clouds, while still offering a single entry point to our users - using GKE, AKS, Amazon and the Oracle cloud. We will cover some issues we had in some of the clouds (mainly networking) and how we solved them. We will show how they get integrated with our main batch system, and how workloads running on external resources access their corresponding datasets.\n\n\"About Ricardo\nRicardo is a software engineer at CERN currently part of the CERN cloud team, focusing primarily on networking and container based deployments.

Our mission is examining how we should change Kubernetes to make it easier to operate. Since the group's formation we have primarily focused on creating kubeadm, a streamlined installer tool and building block to simplify the installation and upgrade experience, and enhance kops, the easiest OSS way to get a production-grade Kubernetes cluster up and running in AWS. We have recently begun building a Cluster API to provide an abstraction of machines across different deployment environments along with a common control plane configuration. In this introduction session, we will present the SIG's mission statement, review recent accomplishments, and discuss our future plans, where you are very welcome to contribute to the discussion. We will also focus on how new contributors can get involved in helping shape the future of Kubernetes' cluster lifecycle management.\n\nAbout Justin\nJustin is one of the kubernetes sig-aws leads and started the kops project, so loves to talk about how to install and operate kubernetes, or on all things kubernetes-on-AWS or on other clouds (particularly GCP, having just joined Google!)\n\nAbout Lucas\nLucas is a passionate Kubernetes Maintainer and Certified Kubernetes Administrator that is excited about all things cloud native. Lucas has been engaged in Kubernetes work for about two years now and been involved in work like porting Kubernetes to multiple platforms, getting Minikube off the ground, being a core contributor in SIG Cluster Lifecycle and maintaining kubeadm. Besides Upper Secondary School Lucas runs a consulting company for Cloud Native tech programming tasks and runs the official CNCF & Kubernetes meetup in Finland. Lucas has been speaking at KubeCon in Berlin and Austin previously, and was awarded the Top Cloud Native Ambassador of 2017 together with Sarah Novotny.\n\nWant to view more sessions and keep the conversations going?

The Story of Apache Beam and gRPC - Ismaël Mejía, Talend (Any Skill Level)\n\nBig data applications have been an almost exclusive domain of Java and Scala developers. This not only frustrates engineers who prefer other languages and their ecosystems, but also impedes companies that already have their business logic written on other platforms from achieving the benefits of reuse when they build data-intensive applications. In this talk we introduce Apache Beam. A unified programming model designed to provide efficient and portable data processing pipelines. We will discuss in detail how Beam achieves portability by relying in two concepts: (1) Runners that translate the Beam's model so it can be executed in existing systems like Apache Spark and Apache Flink and (2) the portability APIs, an architecture of gRPC services that coordinate the execution of pipelines in containers to accomplish language portability.\n\nAbout Ismaël\nSoftware Engineer with more than ten years of experience designing and developing information systems for financial groups, telecom companies and startups.

Today’s container networking technologies can be restrictive as Pod and Service IPs are not reachable externally which forces cluster administrators to operate load balancers. The addition of load balancers introduces new points of failure in a cluster and hinders observability since source IPs are either NAT’d or masqueraded. This talk will be a deep dive of how DigitalOcean uses BGP, Anycast and a variety of open source technologies (kube-router, CNI, etc) to achieve a fast and reliable container network where Pod and Service IPs are reachable from anywhere on DigitalOcean’s global network.

From Kubernetes probes to Istio circuit breaker, the CNCF projects provide us multiple means of containing this kind of problem. After a quick review of all these means, understanding in which cases they can be used and their limitations, we will see how to react to problems that can only be revealed by internal application KPIs. Maybe you would have liked to use a service mesh circuit breaker feature, however your traffic is not HTTP based; or, one pod continues to reply with HTTP code 200 alongside incorrect functional content. And yet, you have functional indicators that that could help take an immediate and orchestrated operational response. We will see how to cover such cases thanks to dedicated controllers and Prometheus.\n\nAbout David\nSenior software engineer at Amadeus. Area of expertize: PaaS.

In the past, easier said than done. Lack of guidance and inconsistent implementations of solutions have made autoscaling on Kubernetes a pain. Tedious extensibility and difficult maintenance with Heapster were some of the causes for this. Those days are over! At Kubernetes sig-instrumentation, we have developed and standardised the resource and custom metrics APIs. These APIs are finally giving Kubernetes the autoscaling capabilities it so desperately needed. Frederic Branczyk, software engineer at CoreOS, will explain the history of autoscaling on Kubernetes, elaborate on the design and usage of these newly developed APIs, and describe how they benefit the consistency of autoscaling. He will talk about the recommended way to autoscale Kubernetes using Prometheus, and end with a demo showcasing just that.\n\nAbout Frederic\nFrederic is an engineer at CoreOS contributing to Prometheus and Kubernetes to build state of the art modern infrastructure and monitoring tools. He discovered his interest in monitoring tools and distributed systems in his previous jobs, where he used machine learning to detect anomalies indicating intrusion attempts.

As a developer, you really want to be able to focus your time on creating new solutions. But as much as you might want to ignore it, you still have to ensure the apps you build scale, stay up and stay secure. Developers still need to understand and control the software supply chain: you still need to know who built what. You need to understand if your software is vulnerable, compliant with your processes and regulations, and secure. And you need to know what is running right now, where it is running, and to be able to control when it changes. So the trick is how to spend as little time as possible on these issues so you can focus on building your app. The combination of Kubernetes and Cloud can make that happen for you. At IBM we are focused on helping you focus. The IBM Cloud Container Service, which leverages Kubernetes, provides advanced capabilities for building cloud-native apps, adding DevOps to existing apps, and ultimately relieves the pain around security, scale, and infrastructure management.&nbsp;\n\nAbout Jason\nJason McGee, IBM Fellow, is VP and CTO of Container and Microservice Tribe.

At that point, we weren't using Kubernetes - and much of what we were using, we built ourselves. At the end of 2016, we decided we wanted to benefit from the work other people were doing and switch over to Kubernetes. But it's not easy to do that kind of move when you have 150+ microservices and you need to keep the existing platform running in parallel while you do the migration. I'm going to talk about this migration and the challenges we faced.\n\nAbout Sarah\nSarah Wells has been a developer for 15 years, leading delivery teams across consultancy, financial services and media. Over the last few years she has developed a deep interest in operability, observability and devops, and this has recently led to her taking over responsibility for Operations and Reliability at the Financial Times. Before that, she lead work at the FT on building a semantic publishing platform, making it easy to discover and access all the FT’s published content via APIs in a common and flexible format.

But how exactly does quorum work, what happens when a node goes down, and how do all of the machines agree on the actual state of your services? Where is the Raft log stored, and how can you inspect it? Come away with deeper understanding of two of Raft&rsquo;s main responsibilities, log replication and leader election, and be better equipped to make informed choices about your service declarations and cluster configurations.\n\nAbout Laura\nAs the Director of Engineering at CloudBees and a Docker Captain, Laura's primary focus is making tools for other developers. At CloudBees, she works on improving the Docker infrastructure of the Codeship product and overall experience for all users of the CI/CD platform. Previously, she worked on several open source projects to support Docker in the early stages of the project, including Panamax and ImageLayers.

However, the one thing that is often overlooked with current solutions is their complete lack of attention to high availability: Typically a failure of your automation hub quickly renders an elegant smart home into an ordinary dumb home. In the pursuit of building a reliable smart home, we will investigate ways to make the open-source automation platform \"home-assistant\" highly available by applying Kubernetes to a not quite standard problem. Some might call it over-engineering, others might call it thorough engineering. In any case, by the end of this talk, we will have explored a more exotic use case for Kubernetes.\n\nAbout Matthias\nMatthias Grüter is an engineer manager on Spotify's Infrastructure and Operations team.

Today’s container networking technologies can be restrictive as Pod and Service IPs are not reachable externally which forces cluster administrators to operate load balancers. The addition of load balancers introduces new points of failure in a cluster and hinders observability since source IPs are either NAT’d or masqueraded. This talk will be a deep dive of how DigitalOcean uses BGP, Anycast and a variety of open source technologies (kube-router, CNI, etc) to achieve a fast and reliable container network where Pod and Service IPs are reachable from anywhere on DigitalOcean’s global network.

A subset of these metrics are used within Kubernetes itself to make scheduling decisions, however, other metrics can be used to determine the overall health of the system or for capacity planning purposes. Kubernetes exposes metrics from several places, some available internally, others through add-on projects. In this session you will learn about:- Node level metrics, as exposed from the node_exporter - Kublet metrics- API server metrics- etcd metrics- cAdvisor metrics- Metrics exposed from kube-state-metrics in this session to learn about how these metrics are calculated, their use within Kubernetes scheduling decisions and application in monitoring, alerting and capacity planning.\n\nAbout Bob\nBob Cotton is a co-founder of FreshTracks.io, a Kubernetes and Prometheus focused monitoring startup. Mr. Cotton bleeds observability based on 22 years designing, architecting, building and running distributed SaaS solutions. Infrastructure and application metrics, full-stack distributed tracing and big-data data analysis pipelines are his tools of choice to provide insight into all aspects of the business.\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona May 20 - 23, Shanghai June 24 - 26, and San Diego November 18 - 21!

From Kubernetes probes to Istio circuit breaker, the CNCF projects provide us multiple means of containing this kind of problem. After a quick review of all these means, understanding in which cases they can be used and their limitations, we will see how to react to problems that can only be revealed by internal application KPIs. Maybe you would have liked to use a service mesh circuit breaker feature, however your traffic is not HTTP based; or, one pod continues to reply with HTTP code 200 alongside incorrect functional content. And yet, you have functional indicators that that could help take an immediate and orchestrated operational response. We will see how to cover such cases thanks to dedicated controllers and Prometheus.\n\nAbout David\nSenior software engineer at Amadeus. Area of expertize: PaaS.

In the past, easier said than done. Lack of guidance and inconsistent implementations of solutions have made autoscaling on Kubernetes a pain. Tedious extensibility and difficult maintenance with Heapster were some of the causes for this. Those days are over! At Kubernetes sig-instrumentation, we have developed and standardised the resource and custom metrics APIs. These APIs are finally giving Kubernetes the autoscaling capabilities it so desperately needed. Frederic Branczyk, software engineer at CoreOS, will explain the history of autoscaling on Kubernetes, elaborate on the design and usage of these newly developed APIs, and describe how they benefit the consistency of autoscaling. He will talk about the recommended way to autoscale Kubernetes using Prometheus, and end with a demo showcasing just that.\n\nAbout Frederic\nFrederic is an engineer at CoreOS contributing to Prometheus and Kubernetes to build state of the art modern infrastructure and monitoring tools.

As a developer, you really want to be able to focus your time on creating new solutions. But as much as you might want to ignore it, you still have to ensure the apps you build scale, stay up and stay secure. Developers still need to understand and control the software supply chain: you still need to know who built what. You need to understand if your software is vulnerable, compliant with your processes and regulations, and secure. And you need to know what is running right now, where it is running, and to be able to control when it changes. So the trick is how to spend as little time as possible on these issues so you can focus on building your app. The combination of Kubernetes and Cloud can make that happen for you. At IBM we are focused on helping you focus. The IBM Cloud Container Service, which leverages Kubernetes, provides advanced capabilities for building cloud-native apps, adding DevOps to existing apps, and ultimately relieves the pain around security, scale, and infrastructure management.&nbsp;\n\nAbout Jason\nJason McGee, IBM Fellow, is VP and CTO of Container and Microservice Tribe.

At that point, we weren't using Kubernetes - and much of what we were using, we built ourselves. At the end of 2016, we decided we wanted to benefit from the work other people were doing and switch over to Kubernetes. But it's not easy to do that kind of move when you have 150+ microservices and you need to keep the existing platform running in parallel while you do the migration. I'm going to talk about this migration and the challenges we faced.\n\nAbout Sarah\nSarah Wells has been a developer for 15 years, leading delivery teams across consultancy, financial services and media.

Kubernetes networking can be even harder. On one hand, kubernetes provides a nice abstraction of infrastructure underneath. On the other hand, k8s contributors and cluster operators bear the burden to seal the gap. Especially for kubernetes networking, it has to work seamlessly with both k8s internals and underlying infrastructure. This brings challenges for understanding and troubleshooting the system. In this talk, we will share real-world experience in running Google Kubernetes Engine and explore the pain points in the current kubernetes networking design, troubleshooting best practices and future improvements.\n\nAbout Minhan\nMinhan Xia has been a member of Kubernetes networking team at Google since 2015. He has contributed to various aspects of K8s networking, including pod networking, K8s service and K8s ingress.\n\nAbout Rohit\nRohit joined Google in August 2017 as a SWE working on GKE Networking and has been working on better monitoring and testing of core GKE systems. Previously, Rohit interned with Google working on Cloud Pub/Sub.\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona May 20 - 23, Shanghai June 24 - 26, and San Diego November 18 - 21!

But how exactly does quorum work, what happens when a node goes down, and how do all of the machines agree on the actual state of your services? Where is the Raft log stored, and how can you inspect it? Come away with deeper understanding of two of Raft&rsquo;s main responsibilities, log replication and leader election, and be better equipped to make informed choices about your service declarations and cluster configurations.\n\nAbout Laura\nAs the Director of Engineering at CloudBees and a Docker Captain, Laura's primary focus is making tools for other developers. At CloudBees, she works on improving the Docker infrastructure of the Codeship product and overall experience for all users of the CI/CD platform.

However, the one thing that is often overlooked with current solutions is their complete lack of attention to high availability: Typically a failure of your automation hub quickly renders an elegant smart home into an ordinary dumb home. In the pursuit of building a reliable smart home, we will investigate ways to make the open-source automation platform \"home-assistant\" highly available by applying Kubernetes to a not quite standard problem. Some might call it over-engineering, others might call it thorough engineering. In any case, by the end of this talk, we will have explored a more exotic use case for Kubernetes.\n\nAbout Matthias\nMatthias Grüter is an engineer manager on Spotify's Infrastructure and Operations team. His team builds and operates tools and the core platform for the rest of Spotify. Matthias has led, coached and managed engineers for over 7 years.

Now is a good time to take stock of Kubernetes' image building support from the perspective of different types of users. In this session, we'll look at a little history of building images for use with Kubernetes. We will review and demo some specific examples with working in this space dating back to the very beginning of Kubernetes and containerized applications, then lead a conversation around some of the challenges and techniques when either building images on or for Kubernetes. Challenges that need to be considered when building images on kubernetes include dependencies on a local docker daemon, security/privilege requirements, and caching+reuse of build artifacts.\n\nAbout Ben\nBen Parees is a Principal Engineer on OpenShift. He serves as the lead for the Developer Experience team which focuses on workflows that take developers from source code to PaaS deployed Docker image based applications, including continuous integration and delivery flows.\n\nAbout Matt\nMatthew co-founded and was the original Tech Lead for the Google Container Registry product, and has been involved with Docker at Google since the beginning. These days, Matthew is focused on Uber TLing container development and firmly believes that we can do better than Dockerfiles. He is the principal author of github.com/google/containerregistry and github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker which enable the construction and manipulation of Docker images without a Docker daemon or root. As a part of building better container images, Matthew believes we should kick the Distro out of our containers.

While monitoring focuses on measuring the overall health of your systems, observability aims to provide granular metrics that describe the behavior of your systems along with their context. Due to both its architecture and focus on providing observability, the service mesh can be a powerful debugging solution when trying to figure out what went wrong with your cloud native applications. In this talk, Franziska shows you how to debug your Kubernetes applications using features of a service mesh in tandem with use of other CNCF projects like OpenTracing. She compares and contrast two different debugging techniques using both Linkerd and Conduit. After attending this talk, you’ll be able to use either approach to debug your Kubernetes-based applications.\n\nAbout Franziska\nFranziska von der Goltz is a software development engineer working on open-source service mesh technology at Buoyant.

These specify the types of access a pod should have in a human readable way. He will also demonstrate an example implementation running in Kubernetes. The current pod security configuration is very low level, and does not really make any sense to users of the system. How can we make security configuration understandable? One route comes from the model of application entitlements that Apple uses on the iPhone to control things like access to Push Notifcations and Payments. The open source libentitlement library, being developed at Docker, enables similarly high level controls to be used for managing containers. The talk will also cover the relationship with Open Policy Agent and other access control frameworks, and relation to Linux Security Modules and PodSecurityPolicy.\n\nAbout Justin\nJustin is a Senior Software Engineer at Docker, working on security. He is based in Cambridge, UK. He is a maintainer of the Moby engine and LinuxKit, and has worked across many open source container projects.

Kubernetes, and more broadly Cloud Native, presents us with better ways to handle our infrastructure. For example, when we need to upgrade to a newer Kubernetes version, we can use automation and tooling to create a new cluster and migrate existing workloads over to it. In this talk, Andy will describe different strategies for moving workloads between clusters. He'll show you how to use tools such as Ansible and Kubeadm to quickly install a new cluster, along with Heptio Ark to back up one cluster and restore into a new one. Andy will also demonstrate how you can perform zero-downtime migrations using Envoy for cluster ingress, traffic shifting, and some DNS “magic.”\n\nAbout Andy\nAndy Goldstein is an engineer at Heptio where he works on tooling to make operating Kubernetes clusters easier, such as Ark, a disaster recovery tool for backing up and restoring Kubernetes workloads and persistent data.

Developing for cloud platforms has many requirements for tooling and behavior of the target cloud platform(s) - for example, maintaining Dockerfiles. There are also many challenges to designing a distributed system that can maintain high consistency, reliability, and availability. We&rsquo;ll explain high level solutions and get into concrete code examples. Key topics are: - Bringing ops requirements into development - Designing for accurate testing - Caching and short term data - Long term storage - Service composition This talk will give developers a foundational understanding of cloud architecture patterns, data management, and requirements building, to empower attendees to hit the ground running.\n\nAbout Vallery\nVallery Lancey is a DevOps Engineer (whatever that means) at Checkfront.

The kubernetes/charts repo has almost 150 different packages today! Helm works by bundling Kubernetes resources together into an easy to use package and allows you to specify dependencies on other packages, enabling deployment of services like databases alongside your application.  But what if you wanted to use a managed database from a cloud provider, instead of running it in your cluster? What if it was as simple as selecting it from a catalog? The service-catalog project is being built to bring this capability to the Kubernetes eco-system using the Open Service Broker API. In this talk, Jeremy will introduce service-catalog and the new resources it brings to Kubernetes. He will also demo how you can use Helm to deliver an application configured to use services provided by the service catalog.\n\nAbout Jeremy\nJeremy Rickard is a software engineer at Microsoft in Colorado working on the Open Service Broker for Azure.

You probably know how to use node affinity, inter-pod affinity, taints, and tolerations. But what if you could use any of the metrics already present in your monitoring infrastructure to dynamically configure the Kubernetes pod scheduler? In this session we will demonstrate how to create a custom Kubernetes scheduler using any monitoring source such as statsd, JMX or Prometheus. We will walk through the code required for a custom scheduler, and end with a short demo. We will provide attendees the source code and placeholder containers required to run the examples in their clusters during this practical session.\n\nAbout Mateo\nIntegrations engineer and tech writer @sysdig Mateo greatly enjoys tinkering with container technologies, creating homebrew lab environments, and the perpetual newbie feeling of this fast moving world of tech.

In particular, the EU's GDPR regulations taking effect this year are forcing organizations to rethink their data management and processing strategies. In this talk, we will demonstrate a data management and processing methodology/framework that is helping organization deploy compliant workflows on top of Kubernetes. The framework, based on the open source Pachyderm project, gives data scientists automatic tracking of changes to data and of all the various pieces of data and processing that lead to particular results. This, along with access control strategies and anonymization (which will also be discussed in the talk), gives organizations a framework that is easy to manage, scalable for AI/ML workflows, and compliant.\n\nAbout Daniel\nDaniel Whitenack (@dwhitena) is a Ph.D. trained data scientist working with Pachyderm (@pachydermIO).

Developer's and IT admins demand that applications, and the micro-services that comprise them, be capable of running in multiple environments. A service mesh, instantiated by Istio, provides a new paradigm for connecting, managing and securing microservices. With services running in multiple clouds, the service mesh has to be established across clouds. In this presentation, John and Robert will show how an application can be stretched between two disparate cloud environments--public cloud and on-prem private cloud. The demonstration will show how the service mesh is stretched to fully enable service mesh features for all services and endpoints in both cloud environments. The summary will discuss how the Istio community has addressed this problem.\n\nAbout Robert\nRobert is a technical lead engineer at Cisco.

In this talk Jen and Maya will focus on a different aspect: runtime security. Runtime security is about mitigating damage done when part of your deployment is compromised. They'll start with an overview of common runtime security concerns, and discuss how they change as you move to containers and Kubernetes. Next, they’ll highlight existing features that help you respond to these risks, and explore popular tools to detect and control compromises. They'll finish off with a demo that shows these techniques in action as they protect a web application. You'll leave with an understanding of how to plan ahead to minimize impact, and how to respond to events when they happen.\n\nAbout Maya\nMaya Kaczorowski is a Product Manager at Google, working in container security, and was previously the Product Manager for Google Cloud KMS.\n\nAbout Jen\nJen is a Security Advocate on Google Cloud Platform.

The project is still ongoing. During the build-out of the kubernetes clusters that are going to power the services responsible for Wikipedia, there were a number of interesting decisions that had to be takenr regarding the networking implementation, the routing of external traffic, the chosen bootstrap method for the clusters and the building methodology for containers and last but not least the transition plan from the old style services to the kubernetes style services.

But it's also a complex topic to understand and get right in production, e.g. if you are new to this topic or running highly dynamic and distributed systems.  Getting the most value out of a Kubernetes cluster requires utilizing the features provided to categorize and prioritize your workloads. We'll look at how Kubernetes provides this functionality through its QoS implementation. Both, from an end-user's perspective but also digging into the mechanics. The work doesn't stop there though. This talk will also explore techniques on how to tune your application using best practices and lessons learned in the field. Finally, we'll provide community resources and an outlook about taking QoS to the next level in your cluster.\n\nAbout Michael\nMichael Gasch is an Application Platform Architect and member of the CTO Ambassador program at VMware.

How are the buzzword terms “production ready” and “highly available” defined anyway? Can a cluster be created so that it’s end-to-end secured, has no single points of failure, is upgradable without control plane downtime and is conformant? If you have access to automated infrastructure, e.g. via a Cluster API controller, you should be able to do CI testing of your cluster, as well as CD of new configuration and versions. Some call this pattern “GitOps”; to write the desired cluster state declaratively and let a controller reconcile the cluster state. By the end of this talk, you should be able to tell: - What you may consider a “production ready” cluster to be and identify the moving parts - How to secure cluster component traffic - How to minimize failure points - How to manage clusters using the Cluster API\n\n\"About Lucas\nLucas is a passionate Kubernetes Maintainer and Certified Kubernetes Administrator that is excited about all things cloud native.

Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America in Seattle, December 11 - 13, 2018 (http://bit.ly/KCCNCNA18) or in Shanghai, November 14-15 (http://bit.ly/kccncchina18).\n\nWhy Running kubelet on your Vacuum Robot is (not) a Good Idea - Christian Simon, Jetstack (Any Skill Level)\n\nThe Xiamio Mi Vacuum Robot is an affordable bit of kit, yet comes with a powerful SoC and utilises a wide range of sensors. A talk at 34C3 last year showed how to gain root access to the underlying Ubuntu Linux operating system. Based on this groundwork, the talk will explain how the vacuum can be provisioned as a node in a Kubernetes cluster. From then on, well-known Kubernetes primitives can be used to control it: CronJobs periodically schedule drives, and a custom Prometheus exporter is used to track metrics about a vacuum’s life. Using custom controllers and CRDs, extended features of the vacuum can be utilised: requesting raw sensor readings, dumping a map of your home, and allowing the vacuum to drive custom paths.\n\nAbout Christian\nChristian can rely on his experiences from working as a Jack of all trades Linux sysadmin for 10+ years. This hands-on practices is backed by his academic work around security practices. Lately he’s focused on providing modern DevOps environments through the heavy use of containers. As soon as he is away from his laptop he enjoys beers and pork dishes (due to his Bavarian roots), visiting if not organising gigs or music festivals and keeping fit with swimming, hiking, skiing and lately playing field hockey.

(Intermediate Skill Level)\n\nIn this talk, Ad van der Veer and and Boris Mattijssen, software engineers at Nerdalize, will talk about building custom schedulers. The goal is that after this talk attendees understand how to build their own a custom scheduler, and are familiar with the tools to do so. As an example they will use a heat-aware scheduler that was developed by Nerdalize to allow them to schedule compute jobs to servers where more heat is needed. This unique need arises from the situation that Nerdalize builds a distributed datacenter, where servers are placed into households, and double as water heaters. After someone takes a shower, their boiler needs to be re-heated. This scheduler allows us to move high-cpu workloads to those servers.\n\nAbout Boris\nBoris Mattijssen is Software Engineer at Nerdalize B.V. a Dutch company.

Consumers are encouraged to stay within brand or risk lack of interoperability. The same can be said about Cloud Vendors. The Open Service Broker API (OSBAPI) is a standard that we can use to avoid Cloud Vendor lock-in. Can Kubernetes and OSBAPI also give us the open connected home consumers dream of? With Kubernetes used as a command and control platform for a connected home with a diverse collection of devices, complex interactions between currently incompatible devices becomes possible. With OSBAPI as the method of interoperability, it can also solve the challenge of a cloud based Kubernetes cluster controlling a on-premise Service Broker without a consistent internet connection or blocked in-bound network communication. This is going to be illuminating.\n\n\"About Scott\nScott Nichols is a Software Engineer at Google.

Containers are enabling organizations to adopt better engineering practices like immutable infrastructure -- increasing deployment agility and reducing mean time to patch. Companies are thinking strategically about to securely manage their software supply chains. Moderated by eWeek's Senior Editor, Sean Michael Kerner, collaborators in the container ecosystem will share how containers are revolutionizing the way apps are secured and how we can expect container security to evolve in the future. The panel will also touch on open source projects Notary, TUF, SPIFFE, and OPA.\n\nAbout Sean\nSean Michael Kerner is a senior editor and his coverage of the technology industry appears in Enterprise Networking Planet, eWeek and ServerWatch to name a few.

This isn’t one word with two divergent meanings, but different approaches that are converging. Sarah will share real-world production use cases that illustrate how developers are using these technologies together.\n\nAbout Sarah\nSarah Allen created early web platforms that were serverless before the term was coined — on the original Shockwave team, she created ways for developers to create apps when the web was young. Later, she did server-ful platforms like Flash video and open source developer tools, at OpenLaszlo and 18F. For the past year, she has worked at the intersection of Firebase and Google Cloud Platform, leading teams developing serverless events for Cloud Functions and an open source cloud policy language.

We can get up and running quickly, but then progress halts if we can’t understand our system. In order to keep moving forward, we need to enforce structure in the right places, while not constraining the benefits of microservices. Just as event sourcing can help us structure communication among services, an evolvable grammar can structure our measurements to enable powerful insights and analytics. This grammar can help us increase cardinality in our logging and allow more tools to provide insight into what is going on.

Storage snapshots -- either on premises or in the cloud -- can offer protection. In the event of a problem, user can roll back to a snapshot from a specific point in time and restore the storage system to that prior state. Snapshots can also be used to replicate data efficiently. In this talk, we present Snapshot feature in Kubernetes. It allows users to create/delete snapshots and restore/clone volumes from snapshots in the same way of managing volumes. We also show to how build custom controller to manage snapshots based on pre-defined policy. The policy specifies how often to take snapshots, what commands to execute before and after taking snapshots, and what is the maximum number of snapshots are allowed. The custom controller can automatically execute snapshotting workflow and clean up old snapshots automatically.\n\nAbout Jing\nJing Xu obtained her Ph.D. from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Florida in May 2011.

The same should be true for your storage if you want to realize the full potential of Kubernetes. We will walk through the architecture of Rook (https://rook.io/), a distributed storage orchestrator for Kubernetes that provides storage to your application pods anywhere Kubernetes runs. We&rsquo;ll explore how to use extension mechanisms such as CRDs as well as patterns like controllers/operators, resource management, and rolling upgrades to build a portable Kubernetes storage solution.\n\nAbout Jared\nJared Watts is a Founding Engineer at Upbound, where he is working on advancing cloud-native computing by \"\"freeing the cloud\"\" and is also a maintainer for the open source Rook project (https://rook.io/).

Edge computing aims to mitigate this network bottleneck by offloading intensive compute and storage to many \"microdatacenters\" at the edge of the network. In this talk, Megan and Steve explore the state of edge computing and its benefits to users in the areas of lower latency, data privacy, and safety. They outline exciting use cases for edge, including machine learning, virtual/mixed reality, video, transportation, and natural disaster detection. Then, they discuss what makes an application \"edge-ready,\" from storage and network requirements to multitenancy and security. Finally, they demonstrate, using a prototype edge management platform built on top of Kubernetes, the process of deploying an edge application to multiple microdatacenters at once.\n\nNote: This demo and our team’s prototypes in Edge Computing are not part of any official Cisco products.\n\nAbout Megan\nMegan is a software engineer at Cisco, where she works on a team dedicated to innovation in cloud, video, and data center technologies.

Such systems in distributed machine learning community often have special requirements and may involve additional efforts. This talk discusses the usage of CoreDNS for service discovery on distributed TensorFlow clusters for resolving deep learning problems. While CoreDNS has been widely used for service discovery in Kubernetes, its unique plugin based design allows CoreDNS to be easily extended and deployed in non-traditional distributed systems as well. Deployed on cloud (AWS), our distributed TensorFlow clusters have been greatly helped by CoreDNS for robustness against partial node failures. The deployment has also been simplified for non-DevOps (e.g., machine learning researchers) to launch and execute deep learning tasks at great ease.\n\nAbout Yong\nYong Tang is a Principal Software Engineer at CTO Office in Infoblox Inc.

Problems which you never see in a small Kubernetes cluster come up as you expand it to a certain scale. Not only tons of logs are caused by polling data from each Kubernetes node, thousands of API calls also causes high CPU usage of OpenStack control nodes. OpenStack Cinder provides a natural fit to support Persistent Volume. But due to volume attaching is an interaction between Nova and Cinder, it leads to issues under large scale. Scaling out Kubernetes degrades service performance drastically because all nodes are inside OpenStack loadbalancer member pools, enabling health monitor or not can make a difference in performance.\n\nAbout Yang\nYang Yu is a software engineer at VMware, working on Kubernetes CNI plugin for VMware NSX.

Complementary, interlocking open source technologies like Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes and the Open Service Broker API are shifting the way industries function. These technologies weave together flexibility and application development for virtually any type of business. What began as a grassroots movement among developers has mushroomed into a massive collaborative community. Linux laid the groundwork in 1991, and the Linux Foundation continues to host the world&rsquo;s leading open source projects. Today, projects like Cloud Foundry and Cloud Native Computing Foundation, as well as standards like the Open Container Initiative, effectively serve as the voice of the people. The developers creating these projects are defining the next generation of technology infrastructure. In this talk, Abby Kearns will discuss the importance of interoperability, and how it is critical to the future success of technologies. Abby will also discuss the role that open source plays in cloud technologies -- delivering a flexible, scalable strategy to drive the future of business.\n\nAbout Abby\nWith nearly twenty years in the tech world, Abby Kearns is a true veteran of the industry.

This talk will dive into three different approaches to compose FaaS functions together to form large applications: _Coordinating Functions_ are functions that manage the execution of other functions by calling them directly. _Event-driven Composition_ uses functions emitting and reacting to events on message queue topics. _Workflows_ introduce a mechanism for expressing a graph of function interactions and having a new runtime to manage the execution of these functions. We'll give examples and live demos for each approach, and compare then on the basis of expressiveness, performance, and fault-tolerance; and also on the basis of operational concerns, such as the ease of doing upgrades, and monitoring the overall application's performance.\n\nAbout Erwin\nErwin is a software engineer at Platform9 Inc, where he works on a workflow engine for Fission, a FaaS on top of Kubernetes.

We then had Docker and rkt, we witnessed the start of runC and OCI. And then with the rise of Kubernetes community, all those container runtimes begin to become quite and hidden behind the orchestration layer, which is expected. But in 2017, we begin to hear more voice of container runtimes again. cri-o, containerd, Kata. But why? In this talk, we would like to say something about technical details of CRI, the killer weapon which brought new energy to \"boring\" container runtimes. We will introduce what is CRI spec and shim, how they are designed, how they work with CNI and CSI, also, what's the difference between those shims and why Kata is special. We will also demo how to write a CRI shim from zero. The second boom of containers is around, while this time it happens in Kubernetes community.\n\nAbout Xu\nXu Wang is the CTO and Cofounder of Hyper HQ, and an initial member of Kata Containers Architecture Committee. HyperHQ created hypervisor-based open source container runtime runV (secure as VM, fast as container). runV merged with clear containers from Intel, and become Kata Containers project in Dec 2017. Hyper HQ provides hyper.sh, a runV/kata based container native Cloud. Before founded HyperHQ, Xu worked in a public cloud in China since 2011 and was working for China Mobile cloud team during 2007 to 2011.

Telepresence allows you to develop services locally as if they were running in your cluster. It does this by proxying pods to your local machine and gives your local services seamless access to service discovery and volumes. With Telepresence, you no longer have to maintain Docker Compose files for local orchestration, and you can take full advantage of Kubernetes features such as Ingress, Secrets/ConfigMaps, RBAC and more. In this demo-led session, we&rsquo;ll take a look at how Telepresence works, the different ways you can use it and how it makes iteratively developing on Kubernetes a breeze.\n\nAbout Ara\nAra Pulido is an engineering manager with more than 10 years of experience working on open source companies.

Long before most Internet or tech giants even existed. The Times is one of the most trafficked news sites on the Internet today with a fairly complex set of services and modules driving our internet presence. We have been using public clouds since 2010 but In 2016 we decided to go all in with the intent to retire our data centers in 2018. As a result one of the biggest projects we undertook was moving our website, CMS and a slew of other internal tools to Amazon and Google's cloud offering. We jumped on the Kubernetes bandwagon and have had a hell of a ride. A lot of our learnings were not technical but cultural. As we went down this path, we found ourselves embracing open standards and tools. We also had learned how to work with product teams who were at various levels of maturity and discipline w.r.t. CI/CD and SRE concepts.\n\nAbout Tony\nI am an engineer on the Delivery and Site Reliability Engineering team at The New York Times, building tools, creating processes, and writing documentation for our many teams of developers. I am currently working on establishing best practices and platforms (Prometheus) to support teams in monitoring and instrumenting their services. Before that I worked on providing the CI/CD platform (Drone) for the organization and developing the launch strategies (Kubernetes) for our datacenter to the cloud migration. The most interesting aspect of my job is organizing and scaling these things to and across an enterprise level organization in production ready states.\n\nAbout Deep\nDeep runs the Delivery Engineering team, responsible for developer tooling and automation, test automation and Site Reliability functions at The New York Times. The New York Times recently underwent a significant transition by moving their entire infrastructure from their data centers to the public cloud. As a part of this migration one of the most significant projects they undertook was to work with the web frameworks and feature teams to move nytimes.com to Kubernetes (GKE specifically). Previous speaking experience: Deep has been a speaker at the MongoDB conference in 2012 in the past as well as appeared recently on the GCP Podcast to talk about the adoption of Kubernetes and other Cloud Native tools at The New York Times.\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona May 20 - 23, Shanghai June 24 - 26, and San Diego November 18 - 21!

Two years ago, all of Spotify’s services ran on on our own hardware. Today, they are running in Google Cloud Platform, and Spotify is in the process of replacing many of the proprietary systems with cloud native solutions like kubernetes, gRPC, and istio. James and Dave will talk about the work that went into moving services into GCP and how Spotify got to where it is today. They will then cover ongoing work and plans to modernize the service infrastructure and migrate to cloud native services. This includes running service in kubernetes on GKE, migrating from a proprietary messaging stack to gRPC, as well as integrating the new infrastructure with existing service discovery and monitoring systems.\n\nAbout Dave\nDave Zolotusky is a software engineer on Spotify's Infrastructure and Operations team in Stockholm, Sweden.

Approaching such a large and dynamic project can be daunting. While a relative newcomer to the kubernetes project, the speaker has twenty plus years of open source developer experience from which to draw on within the 1.10 release team as bug triage shadow and for 1.11 as the bug triage lead. Embedded service to the community within the release team, especially in a cross-SIG bug-focused role, provides a unique opportunity for contributor insights. This is not a 1.10 release retrospective (see pres. by Jaice Singer DuMars &amp; Ihor Dvoretskyi), but the talk will walk through the release process, its phases, how the process is evolving through time and will use 1.10 specific examples to highlight areas ripe for new contributors to engage and grow.\n\nAbout Tim\nTim is a software engineer with over 20 years open source development experience.

(Advanced Skill Level)\n\nContainers have had uncanny abilities to build, manage, and distribute changes as part of the containers filesystems through the use of layers and graphdrivers. A critical part of the magic making people's experience with containers delightful, this is considered a necessity in any container-based system. The complexity and integration of graphdrivers makes working with them directly cumbersome and error prone. containerd departs from this and introduces a new abstraction, known as snapshotters. Mounting a container&rsquo;s filesystem, direct manipulation, arbitrary diffing, and native copying, previously a challenge, are all now possible with minimal effort. In this talk, we'll cover the evolution of Docker  graphdrivers to containerd snapshotters, demonstrating the wonderful properties of snapshotters in the process.\n\nAbout Stephen\nStephen Day is a software engineer at Docker.

Unfortunately, the continuous delivery supply chain has become an attractive target for attacks. An attacker that compromises any of the steps of the supply chain, or alters the product in transit, can target all users at once. In this talk Wendy Dembowski and Lukas Puehringer will introduce in-toto and grafeas(grafeas.io), a software supply chain security ecosystem to verify the supply chain integrity, authenticity, and compliance of any application. The talk will feature real-life examples, such as the target deployments for various popular projects, including Debian, Arch Linux, reproducible builds, and Docker.\n\nAbout Wendy\nWendy is a Staff Software Engineer at Google. She is a co-founder and the Khaleesi of Grafeas.\n\nAbout Lukas\nLukas Puehringer is a research scholar and developer at NYU's Center for Cyber Security (CCS), where he leads, the development of in-toto and has been co-maintaining several of Prof. Justin Cappos' software projects, such as the Seattle and Sensibility Network Testbeds and The Update Framework (TUF).

As glue code that links cloud services together it is tempting to forget about the security of functions being deployed. In this talk we will discuss the very important security considerations that we still need to keep in mind with serverless functions. Using kubeless, the kubernetes native serverless solution and focusing on AWS EKS deployment we will discuss how Pod identity, Pod security context, Network Policies, AWS IAM profiles and API gateways can all be used in concert to create a secure serverless application.\nDemonstrations will highlight how Kubernetes brings critical value-add to a serverless solution and will re-inforce the need for a strong security mindset for cloud-native applications.\n\nAbout Sebastien Goasguen\nSeb has been working on Kubernetes since June 2014, he is the author/co-author of the O'Reilly Docker cookbook and the Kubernetes cookbook. With many years of experience teaching computer science he stills enjoys teaching people Kubernetes and getting them off the ground and on their container journey. Currently he works at Bitnami where he oversees all things Kubernetes, he prototyped Kubeless, the Kubernetes native serverless framework and other community tools like kompose and Cabin. In 2008 he was selected for the first round of Astronaut selection by ESA but sadly is still stuck on earth.\nJoin us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona May 20 - 23, Shanghai June 24 - 26, and San Diego November 18 - 21!

In this talk, we’ll discuss various isolation approaches and evaluate them through the eyes of an attacker who has compromised a node and is looking to propagate.    We’ll deep dive on ‘node isolation’: using Kubernetes scheduling to execute workloads on separate nodes, and demonstrate live attacks and defences to educate about strengths and weaknesses of this strategy.

On the Demand side, Kubernetes treats Pods as first class citizens with their own IPs. This makes port mappings and usage from a developer’s point of view much much simpler. But from an infrastructure perspective, this makes the whole cluster use IP addresses liberally.  On the Supply side, Kubernetes deployments generally run alongside incumbent networks. Therefore there are not enough IPs to allocate and have a production grade deployment.  Based on real world experience by our customers so far, we have found that there are a few ways to design your clusters to address these concerns: -- Optimize the per node allocation so that the overall consumption can be optimized -- re-use IP addresses for Infrastructure but have unique Services IPs. -- Leverage a new IP addressing scheme through non-RFC 1918 ranges","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNLwDEfMfMY","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TNLwDEfMfMY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/UaVq","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Mahesh Narayanan","role":"Product Manager, Google","bio":"Mahesh Narayanan is a Cloud Networking Product Manager at Google Cloud.

As companies adopt more of these workloads, tracking resource consumption and optimizing spending becomes more challenging.    \n\nAt Lyft, we developed a system which scrapes metrics from Kubernetes clusters and persists them in data warehouses. We then built a pipeline that transforms snapshots into cluster utilization metrics along the dimensions of CPU, memory, and GPU. Finally we join these metrics into our cost and usage dataset, so teams can budget resources accordingly and reduce spending.    In this talk, we will give an overview of Infraspend - our infrastructure for tracking Kubernetes usage.

At 2017, KubeCon NA Tim Hockin and Michael Rubin started a conversation on formalizing “Kubernetes upstream as a distro”, proposing we clean up thinking/processes, define tools/standards, incentivize distros to stay close. They argued for a Kubernetes reference distribution focused on correctness and stability.    So where is it?    After a slow start, we have momentum in 2019 to improve conformance, API stability, and better documented support stances.

Better accounting leads to improved node stability, density, and more accurate charging users based on their actual resource utilization. Unfortunately, there are gaps in resource accounting in Kubernetes today, mostly based on the fact that running a pod is not actually free.    In Kubernetes 1.16, the PodOverhead feature is introduced to fix these issues.

Rivera & Rohan Gupta, Red Hat \n\nRaw block PersistentVolumes (PVs) allow applications to consume storage in a new way. In particular, Rook-Ceph now makes use of them to provide the backing store for its clustered storage in a more Kubernetes-like fashion and with improved security. Now we can rethink the notion of how we structure our storage clusters, moving the focus away from static nodes and basing them on more dynamic, resilient devices.    This talk will go over how we incorporated raw block PVs, how the operator manages them, and how we can now define storage cluster. It will also include a demo of the resiliency of these new types of devices. By the end of the talk, you'll not only know how to use raw block PVs but also why and when to use them.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j4ViEfVcWg","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5j4ViEfVcWg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/UaWo","projects":["Ceph","Rook","Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Jose A.

One of the challenges is to securely and efficiently manage containerized application packages with either container image or Helm Chart format. Project Harbor is an open-source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, manages, signs, and scans content, thus resolving common image or Helm Chart management challenges. In this presentation, we will focus on the management of container images and Helm Charts through Harbor. We will review and provide solutions to the challenges faced by organizations, including RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), vulnerability scanning, large scale content distribution, content replication, content trust (notary), webhook, tag retention, and DevOps integrations, etc..

Successful adoption of Kubernetes by services led to more and faster adoption leading to challenges of scale. Facing this, Airbnb switched to a multiple production cluster architecture to get around single cluster scalability limits and ensure ample capacity for services.   \n\n This process increased the consistency of the cluster configurations while reducing manual operations. This talk will discuss the problems that were faced during scaling, the shape of the solutions, specific approaches that worked well (and didn’t), and how this was accomplished without a drastic shift away from existing pre-Kubernetes infrastructure tooling. A key result was reducing the time to create a new, production-ready cluster from over a week to under an hour.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay7NibpRAYU","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ay7NibpRAYU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/Uacr","projects":["Kubernetes","Architect"],"speakers":[{"name":"Ben Hughes","role":"Software Engineer, Airbnb","bio":"Ben Hughes has worked on database scaling, Ruby and Node.js performance, incident response, and Kubernetes at Airbnb.

The energy and innovation of this community is transforming our company. Our first forays into the world of containers were inward-looking and produced some false starts. As we have engaged more with the community around Kubernetes, you have flipped our perspective from infrastructure up to developer down.  Now we’re moving with the ecosystem and making our biggest technology bet in a decade—embedding Kubernetes in our flagship product, vSphere.

These modern solutions, however, build on top of legacy layers that predate cloud computing as we now know it. Rethinking and reinventing these lower layers of the system stack can offer even greater improvements in density, performance, and security.  One such example is at the VMM layer, which commonly depends on software that includes emulation and other unnecessary features. The rust-vmm project provides an alternative approach: a toolkit to build workload-specific virtual machine monitors. This keynote will discuss new developments in that project, from support of lightweight virtual machines to FaaS, and why you’d want to use different VMMs for these different delivery models.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8bp7fe7wuY","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u8bp7fe7wuY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/UdPq","projects":["Kubernetes","Envoy","Prometheus"],"speakers":[{"name":"Arjan van de Ven","role":"Intel Fellow, Intell","bio":"Arjan van de Ven is an Intel Fellow as well as Linux and data-centric software architect in SystemSoftware Products at Intel Corp.

It utilizes the Kubernetes custom resource functionality and API extensions to deploy and manage complex, stateful, scale-out applications.  This session will: describe the limitations of existing tools for complex stateful applications, provide an overview of the KubeDirector architecture and how it overcomes these limitations, and demonstrate how to author the metadata to deploy a stateful application on Kubernetes with KubeDirector","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kEk5wLe9g","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X2kEk5wLe9g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/UaaF","projects":["Kubernetes","Helm","Architect"],"speakers":[{"name":"Joel Baxter","role":"Distinguished Engineer, Hewlett Packard Enterprise","bio":"Joel is a Distinguished Engineer in the Storage and Big Data organization at HPE.

To save millions of dollars by efficient use of cluster resources, Uber is planning to use Kubernetes to co-locate BigData/ML and micro-service workloads.  Kubernetes is the de-facto standard for running micro-services. However, in comparison to YARN, it still lacks many features like hierarchical resource pools, elastic resource sharing, gang scheduling etc. To bridge this gap, we have re-architected Peloton to be a set of Kubernetes scheduler and controller plugins so that we can provide feature parity with YARN.

Checking Best Practices on Live Kubernetes Clusters - Varsha Varadarajan & Adam Wolfe Gordon, DigitalOcean  \n\nWhile Kubernetes is stable, best practices for using it are a moving target. Some are generally applicable, others unique to a particular configuration or platform. Following best practices helps ensure workloads stay running as expected through cluster maintenance and upgrades, but checking them can feel like playing whack-a-mole in the dark.    This talk introduces a new open source tool, clusterlint, that checks compliance with best practices.

To get optimum performance out of Ancestry’s cloud applications, Ancestry employed artificial intelligence for continuous optimization of the application runtime environment. AI brings continuous optimization (CO) to the CI/CD process. In a PoC, Ancestry used AI to cut the resources of one application by more than 50 percent, with zero drop in performance. In this instance, Ancestry has been able to get two times the performance out of Kubernetes for every dollar spent.

Knative and Istio help with autoscaling, scale-to-zero, canary deployments to be implemented, and scenarios where traffic is optimized to the best performing models.

Most discussions focus on scalability either at a single point in time under sustained load, or explore challenges related to changes in incoming traffic.   But running distributed systems at scale is about more than steady states and transitions between them. What is equally challenging and tends to get overlooked are the operational challenges of running at scale: upgrading many and/or large clusters; deploying applications to and across multiple clusters in a reasonable way; balancing freedom and consistency across multiple teams. In this case study, Google and Spotify share some of the challenges of running Kubernetes at Scale, together with concrete solutions, patterns, and common pitfalls we have found together.

Implementing resource limits, requests and quotas are often the first steps taken to solve this problem at the pod or namespace level. However, the behaviour of an overall Kubernetes cluster as it nears capacity and the parameters available to tune it are often overlooked. To ensure optimal stability and utilization of a cluster, users must learn how to implement, test and manage these parameters over time.

Kubernetes gives developers abstractions and APIs to deploy and run their services.     Yet, the elephant in the room is that to run, maintain and evolve Kubernetes clusters, we need more ops expertise and most likely a dedicated team to do so.    The question that begs to be asked is if we risk going back to pre-DevOps isolation between Dev and Ops teams? Is the tradeoff between better operational tools and introducing a new dependency layer on the path to production for application teams worthwhile? Are we making life easier for application teams or instead reducing their end-to-end ownership?

Condé Nast International is a digital-first company, targeting to migrate 34 out of 62 existing websites to the Kubernetes clusters across the globe.  Kubernetes underpins Condé Nast International's entire infrastructure, and Helm is used as the de facto deployment package manager. These two components were critical for the delivery of the highest developer experience.  In time, the development teams became self-sufficient and started to contribute to the base Helm charts instead of going the feature requests route.

If multi-tenancy is added to the mix, the challenges of bootstrapping identities that work across clusters - but within tenancy - are even greater.  In this presentation, Manish Mehta will share challenges of securely bootstrapping identities in such a setup (especially when the individual clusters could be running in untrusted environments), the tradeoffs, and possible solutions.

Optimizing startup time is critical to support use cases such as autoscaling, upgrades, and failure recovery. The recent rise of the serverless model, along with its key value proposition of scale-to-zero of idle workloads, has made pod startup time important than ever: The platform must be able to start the pod fairly quick, such that the latency of request-triggered scale-from-zero is acceptable.   In this talk, we'll analyze the latency contributed by Istio service mesh to pod startup time, right from pod creation and up to the pod becoming ready to service requests.

This is a good pattern to enable applications to be composed of heterogeneous components and technologies by reducing coupling.    The demands of using sidecar containers in production environments are rapidly increasing, although sidecars have not formally identified. More issues and discussions have cropped up in Kubernetes community and slack channels.    Thus, we need a fine-grained way to manage the sidecars, including the starting/terminating order, the lifecycle of sidecars, etc. Also pre and post steps are introduced to better control the sidecars.

This leads to large images which developers try to trim down by using multistage builds, removing files and squashing filesystem layers. Building container images in this way makes it difficult if not impossible to ascertain the license and security implications of using these images.    How do we generate app specific build and runtime images without having to maintain our own base OS images and build machinery?

Learn how Lyft built, and deployed Envoy Mobile (envoy-mobile.github.io) in their Swift/Kotlin apps and is benefitting from a single, consistent Envoy-based network stack across every platform.  Envoy Mobile was created to provide apps with the same network configurability, observability, and transport technologies that Envoy Proxy enables for the server - as if apps are simply another node on a service mesh. This unlocked a new tier of reliability on mobile and paved the way for many enhancements such as QUIC, request prioritization, and low connectivity handling.

Hear how developing a strong culture around Chaos Engineering has paid off at Target. We'll share our journey from experimenting locally to running multi-team GameDays. Chaos Engineering is a disciplined approach to identifying failures before they become outages. By proactively testing how a system responds under stress, you can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news. Chaos Engineering lets you compare what you think will happen to what actually happens in your systems. You literally break things on purpose to learn how to build more reliable systems. Lenny Sharpe walks you through Chaos Engineering at Target, covering the tools and practices you need to implement Chaos Engineering with Kubernetes in your organization. Even if you’re already using Chaos Engineering, you’ll learn to identify new ways to use the practice to improve the reliability of your network and services.

As the ecosystem expanded, the increased latency and data transfer costs became significant. To facilitate future growth efficiently, Intuit needed a better model. Moving to a distributed Service Mesh running on k8s to enable secure service-to-service communication was the solution. As Intuit was building a migration path for hundreds of services communicating across discrete networks, they faced a host of challenges. While developing a platform to provide end-to-end encryption, they defined a pattern for federated workload identities and learned to manage a federated set of mesh control planes.

This rather complex approach is blissfully straight-forward to implement in Prometheus, as demonstrated in the chapter itself. However, all of it is based on error rates, leaving latency concerns out of scope. Björn “Beorn” Rabenstein will explore various options of applying the same ideas to latency-based SLOs. The foundation is a precise and meaningful definition of the SLO. From there, Beorn will explore various techniques to translate the SLO into an error budget and how to measure its burn rate with Prometheus. Once that is done, creating error-budget-based alerts is relatively simple. There are, however, pitfalls and trade-offs along the way, which Beorn will help cope with.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X99X-VDzxnw","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X99X-VDzxnw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/UaZQ","projects":["Rio","Grafana","Prometheus"],"speakers":[{"name":"Björn Rabenstein","role":"Engineer, Grafana Labs","bio":"Björn “Beorn” Rabenstein is an engineer at Grafana and a Prometheus developer.

Laws such as the GDPR in Europe stipulate where a user’s data needs to be physically located, as well as when it can be transferred out of the EU. We expect additional legal jurisdictions to pass similar laws in the coming years, and that database management systems will require native functionality to assist in compliance. In the case of Vitess, one of its distinguishing features is support for flexible sharding schemes. This can easily be extended to support a custom sharding scheme that respects geo-partitioning requirements. In this deep dive we will first explore how and then demonstrate a database cluster built using the custom sharding scheme that solves data residency at the database layer obviating the need for any change at the application layer.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hz6LFJu1cY","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Hz6LFJu1cY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/UagI","projects":["Vitess"],"speakers":[{"name":"Jiten Vaidya","role":"CEO, PlanetScale","bio":"Jitendra (Jiten) Vaidya is co-founder and CEO at PlanetScale (https://planetscale.com), a company that supports Vitess (https://vitess.io).

A single binary app which can act as a monolith but can also be scaled as microservices. Thanos being a great example, where the kickstart is super simple yet can be scaled out as required.

There’s no one-size-fits-all on what are the appropriate metrics to drive promotions. Often, the four golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) are used, but what if this isn’t enough? More sophisticated techniques might use algorithmic or even AI-driven analysis.

Up till now, the answer has always been simply turn off hard-limits, but that has potentially nasty performance implications in shared environments. Now there's another option! This session will explain the real root cause of what has been happening. We'll introduce the kernel mechanisms that Kubernetes and other Container Orchestrators rely on to enforce CPU limits.

In the past, CRD has been mainly used for out-of-tree, third-party things. Today, with the constant improvement of CRD, there is an ongoing effort to refine and enhance Kubernetes as an modular and extensible platform by factoring everything but the bare essentials out of “core” Kubernetes. CRDs and their controllers start to be used for managing even in-tree, first-party Kubernetes resources.    In this session, We will take you on a journey of building CRDs as first class citizens in Kubernetes based on our first-hand experience. This made us believe that CRDs can be used for core resources and integrated seamlessly with other core API objects. We will also introduce Kubebuilder, a SDK to build and publish Kubernetes APIs, and explain how Kubebuilder makes it easy to write a custom controller for CRD.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Shanghai '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzaNFXHYJOU","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VzaNFXHYJOU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/NrqD","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Jing Xu","role":"Software Engineer, Google","bio":"Jing Xu obtained her Ph.D. from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Florida in May 2011.

By running various controllers on top of these CRD objects, we use k8s to manage k8s, and the entire eBay data center.  - Our system provisions hosts the same way k8s creates and manages pods.  - We build k8s clusters with Salt. each host has a set of states defined in its salt CRD object. controllers pull states from git based on commit ids to apply.  - We build both schedulers and deployment transactions to manage the k8s clusters for both config deployments and upgrades.

In all cases, this raw data need to be refined effectively to understand what next action to take.  This presentation covers our approaches to the application of data visualization, filtering, and categorization. We are also trying to employing relevant technologies such as deep learning. Our ultimate goal is to display the results efficiently, allow users to quickly narrow down the problems and better monitor the farm to support the complex continuous delivery pipelines.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Shanghai '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doT9IFO8dhk","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/doT9IFO8dhk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/NrwA","projects":[],"speakers":[{"name":"Lan Xia","role":"Software Developer, IBM","bio":"Lan Xia is a team lead in Functional Verification Team in IBM Runtime Technologies.

In this presentation, we propose an SPDK(Storage Performance Development Kit, https://spdk.io) userspace vhost-user-fs solution, which can be used together with QEMU/Kata Container to accelerate virtio-fs. Virtio-fs uses FUSE instead of 9P for communication. We will present this solution in details including the utilization of techniques such as virtio-fs, blobfs (SPDK file system) and the significant performance gain achieved. Blobfs can be built on abstract block device layer in SPDK, which can access local or remote storage services via iSCSI/NVMe/NVMeoF protocols in userspace.

With Kubernetes commonly deployed in a virtualized infrastructure like vSphere or OpenStack, network information at Kubernetes worker node level is not enough. If we want to guarantee those special applications won't get blocked anywhere in a cluster, we need to reserve network bandwidth for worker nodes in the whole cluster and use that information in the algorithm of scheduler.

Starting out with just a few servers it's simple to configure and run, as you start to scale out you adopt novel strategies such as federation and meta monitoring to ensure you can get all the metrics you need. But what happens when you scale out past a single cluster? What happens when you scale out past a single cloud provider?    In this talk, you will learn how at Improbable we have been able to successfully scale our metrics platform to reach a global scale. Prometheus is a solid foundation to our platform which is extended by Thanos an OSS project to allow global querying and high availability of Prometheus scrapers. Then by adding in Envoy, we can unlock cross-cluster, cross-cloud communication allowing our engineers to monitor our platform across the globe.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Shanghai '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUtAGyGN7Sk","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UUtAGyGN7Sk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/Nro8","projects":["Kubernetes","Envoy","Architect","Prometheus","Thanos"],"speakers":[{"name":"Dominic Green","role":"Software Engineer, Improbable","bio":"Dom was the first cadet to outsmart the Kobiashi Maru, completed the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, and beat Parzival to the First Gate.

How do you improve the security of your workloads without giving up the properties of containers that you've come to love? There are many approaches to sandboxing containers, such as virtual machines and unikernels, but which is right for you?  gVisor is a unique open-source sandbox runtime that allows you to run unmodified applications in containers with a higher level of isolation and low overhead. In this talk I will explore the container security model of gVisor and use cases for sandboxing containers. I will discuss various approaches and their tradeoffs before diving into the architecture of gVisor and how it differs from virtual machine based sandboxes.

Aiming to “demystify” load balancing in K8s, I’d like to share my experience utilizing these cloud-native load balancing techniques, discussing their tradeoffs and applicable scenarios.    The journey starts with a simple VIP iptable implementation. Then we dive deeper and examine from client to server, kernel to userspace, going up from IP to HTTP.

A simple, easy API for scalable compute in any cloud: just a Deployment and a Service and you’re done! But as you use it more, you learn that this isn't really enough. A production system needs requests and limits, liveness checks, HPAs, PDBs, PSPs, etc.    The same is true for Istio, which can solve a lot of the problems with microservices out of the box, but isn't magic. When you get beyond playing with bookinfo, more configuration is needed to get the most out of it.

In this talk, we look beyond Kubernetes’ usage for container orchestration and extend the Kubernetes API to the management of external resources (not running on pods or nodes). Imagine if an application developer writing a monitoring framework could ask for a SQL database and message queue for their application in the same way that the Kubernetes API enables them to ask for an abstract PersistentVolumeClaim backed by a concrete PersistentVolume implementation. We can imagine that this developer might also expose the monitoring framework as a resource for consumption by other applications. In this talk we explore the use of this new approach to facilitate composability and reuse of resources within heterogeneous applications.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Shanghai '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n23EfZHriQs","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/n23EfZHriQs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/Nrlf","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Steve Judkins","role":"Dir. of Program Management, Upbound","bio":"Steve runs program management at Upbound, where he is working on advancing cloud-native computing by \"freeing the cloud\".

In 2017, Netflix is recognized as one of the industry leaders at building and operating “cloud native” systems at scale. Like many organizations, Netflix has unique security requirements for many of their workloads. This variety requires a holistic approach to authorization to address “who can do what” across a range of resources, enforcement points, and execution environments.\n\nIn this talk, Manish Mehta (Senior Security Software Engineer at Netflix) and Torin Sandall (Technical Lead of the Open Policy Agent project) will present how Netflix is solving authorization across the stack in cloud native environments. The presentation shows how Netflix enforces authorization decisions at scale across various kinds of resources (e.g., HTTP APIs, gRPC methods, SSH), enforcement points (e.g., microservices, proxies, host-level daemons), and execution environments (e.g., VMs, containers) without introducing unreasonable latency. The presentation includes a deep dive into the architecture of the cloud native authorization system at Netflix as well as how authorization decisions can be offloaded to an open source, general-purpose policy engine (Open Policy Agent).\n\nThis talk is targeted at engineers building and operating cloud native systems who are interested in security and authorization.

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) was launched with the goal of developing common, minimal, open standards and specifications around container technology without the fear of lock-in. OCI has recently issued v1.0 of its container image format and runtime specifications, which enable a consistent and stable platform for running containerized applications. \n\nThe next phase in ensuring broad adoption of common container image format and runtime specifications is the OCI Certification program, which will be launching soon. This session will provide an overview and goals of the program, factors to consider if becoming OCI-certified makes sense for your container project, how to get your container project OCI-certified, and how you might be able to gain interoperability benefits from OCI-certified solutions.

The threats targeting organizations only continue to increase in severity and frequency, and even simple attacks can cause considerable damage. Cloud-native development is a vital evolution for security in the enterprise, as it equips organizations with the same tools and processes that modern fast-moving organizations rely on. \n\nCloud-native needs to be considered a new culture, not just a technological shift, when it comes to IT. This is because cloud-native changes the processes of DevOps, which requires automated security processes and application awareness. With cloud-native culture, security needs to be truly application aware and based upon developer intent. Using application intent analysis, developers have a new way of looking at applications, specifically containerized apps. They can produce produce a more predictable and secure container environment that can be effectively enforced.\n\nThe unique nature of container technology allows the developer intent-based security model to capitalize on the following pillars: \n\n1. Containers are declarative. When a developer writes the code, he/she does not just write the code, he/she writes a manifest that describes how this code should work and how it should interact with its environment. While the developer does not provide you with a real security manifest, you can translate the extra information that you have and try to create a security profile. With containers, you have a Docker file, you might have a pod, and you might have an application group if you’re running on top of mesosphere. There is a lot of information in the system that you could use in order to understand what is supposed to happen.\n\n2. Containers are predictable. When you look at containers, they contain less specific logic and more common building blocks because containers are typically made out of downloadable layers that someone else created. \n\n3. Containers are immutable. In the past, it was hard to understand if something happening with the application was really an attack or not. But in the case of containers, whenever you patch a container or change its real intent, it should not happen in real time. What happens is the developer changes things and then he/she pushes in a new version. He patches the OS or adds new functionality and then pushes in a new container and scratches the old one. This gives you a lot of power from a security standpoint because, for the first time ever, if you see a polymorphic change in the behavior of the application (if it starts behaving differently) that means it’s either a configuration drift or a real attack.\n\nBy leveraging these three pillars -- declarative nature, predictability and immutability -- there’s a powerful opportunity to use whitelisting, for example, to approve known good processes. In combination with application intent analysis, enforcement measures help support the intent-based security model and preserve the original intent of the application.\n\nAbout John Morello\nJohn Morello is the Chief Technology Officer at Twistlock.

In the face of highly dynamic compute and network resources, a new challenge has risen: how to authenticate and secure service-to-service traffic in this brave new world? Enter the problem known as service identity.\n\nGetting service identity right is surprisingly hard, with requirements extending well beyond simple secret management. What kind of credentials to settle on, how to rotate them, how to automatically (and securely) bootstrap them... and even more importantly, how to make sure a wide variety of external systems can authenticate them appropriately? These questions represent only a subset of the points that must be solved for.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce both SPIFFE and SPIRE - a new open source project designed to solve exactly these problems. SPIRE, backed by the SPIFFE open standard, performs seamless node and workload attestation across various platforms, and automatically issue short-lived certificates based on those attestations in a controlled manner. Even better, these certificates work across organizational boundaries and heterogeneous environments thanks to SPIFFE, which introduces a standardized identity format and validation methodology for X.509 certificates.\n\nAbout Evan Gilman\nEvan Gilman is an engineer with a background in computer networks.

While environments like amazon have vastly simplified the supply chain associated with brining up new physical and virtual infrastructure or services, complexity around managing access to and between these services has grown, and continues to expand.  The proliferation of configurations, management tools, and management schemes that exists in the modern datacenter has exploded when dealing with multi-cloud, hybrid (cloud + dc), or legacy systems.\n\nComplexity is the enemy of security.  This heterogeneity is its embodiment. Having many different ways to configure access policies on different cloud providers or with different vendors, makes it impossible to understand whom has access to what in any given infrastructure.  Without this visibility it is impossible to have intelligibility, and hence security.  \n\nWorse, today developers and operators must exist in and support a highly dynamic service environment.  That is to say existing services must evolve to support new functionality, and new services must be rapidly brought on line to support features in a highly competitive business environment.  The miasma of different configuration schemes creates a great deal of friction against this, and impedes security because it is difficult to holistically understand the impact of changes (let alone make them rapidly).  Security must be able to accommodate this temporality.\n\nIn this talk we introduce PADME as an architecture for policy admission aimed at solving these problems in a distributed environment.  PADME operates by normalizing access policy information across underlying clouds and system.  It allows policies to be operated up as known fixed building blocks in order to establish end to end security.  Finally, it attacks the problem of policy distribution in a distributed environment so that assertions can be made about the security of a system over time, and in the face of CAP theorem issues.\n\nAbout Jeyappragash JJ\nJeyappragash previously built the team and lead the technical roadmap for Twitter's Cloud Infrastructure Management Platform.

What's less well understood is how to do it for thousands of services running on behalf of hundreds of possibly competing customers, in particular how to do it securely, protect the privacy of each customer, and support binary protocols other than HTTP. This is the problem that our company solved for our SaaS business which requires hosting and operating the control plane of popular infrastructure management software (e.g. Openstack, Big Data, and Kubernetes itself) as a service for our customers. Those control planes contain services exposing protocols as varied as MySQL and AMQP. This talk describes the challenges we faced and how we solved them using multiple technologies from the Kubernetes ecosystem. The solution includes a system that automatically creates namespaces, provisions certificate hierarchies, and manages ingress controllers for new customers, then wraps services with a set of side-car containers to handle tasks such as TLS termination. We describe how we employed Kubernetes native constructs such as Custom Resource Definitions to automate those tasks. For network communications, we discuss how to securely handle ingress, outgress, pod-to-pod, and cross-namespace traffic. To support both HTTP and TCP-based protocols, we describe a two-level network routing system consisting of both a \"k8sniff\" and an nginx ingress controller. For ensuring customer data privacy we compare these approaches: (1) Network Policy + Layer 2 virtualization; (2) TLS encryption of all pod-to-pod traffic; (3) a combination of the two. Finally, we debate whether the process isolation model of Linux containers is sufficient, and discuss our experience with stronger virtualization-based mechanisms such as Frakti / HyperContainer.\n\nAbout Bich Le\nCo-founder of Platform9 and veteran of VMware.

With orchestration clusters supporting thousands of nodes, any risk assessment solution must work at production scale. Once a trusted image is deemed vulnerable, application risk increases, but which applications are impacted, and how far has trust been broken? Trust is established through best practices including the use of trusted image registries, static code analysis, fuzzing, strong perimeter defenses and deployment controls. Unfortunately, this trust model omits information flow.\nMalicious actors succeed when applications are most vulnerable. When devising action plans in response to security disclosures, defenders must quickly assess both the impact and scope of the disclosure. This time to remediation requires accurate and actionable vulnerability assessments as applications are created, deployed and scaled.

One common intelligent edge deployment is the buildout of mini data centers on network edge that are centrally managed and operated by the cloud. Unlike traditional data centers, these mini data centers are constrained by limited resources and minimal operational supervision, and as such they impose challenges on traditional data center infrastructure including network services, here defined as L3-7 network services such as packet gateway and application firewall. These services usually are implemented with the need for heavy manual configurations and complex provisioning, which are particularly ill-fitted to deploy at the edge.\n\nIn this session we will discuss how we built a new edge computing platform for network services that can achieve auto provisioning, dynamic service deployments and updates, and high resiliency. By running componentized network services in containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, and utilizing projects such as gRPC, linkerd, and fluentd, as well as making use of cloud native related projects including etcd and IOvisor, this platform essentially treats network services as cloud native applications, and thereby able to achieve the associated benefits.

While we still have work to do, in the past several months the community has done great work to solve a whole host of issues to make Kubernetes “suck less.” In this talk I will outline the ways that the community has made this happen both in the core project and in the wider ecosystem.\n\nThings are still developing, but here are the areas that I want to highlight. Hopefully we'll have talks on many of these so that I can highlight where and when folks can find out more. I won't be able to cover everything happening in the ecosystem but I can hint at the diversity and commitment to solving these issues.\n\n* *Simpler application description.* As a community we are continuing to build more tcapable and simpler tools for describing applications through projects like ksonnet, OpenCompose, Kompose, and Helm.\n* *Serverless platforms.* Through “function as a service” like systems we can abstract much of the nitty gritty around getting code packaged and running. In addition, scaling can be easy and automatic as code is run only when needed.\n* *Simpler cluster install and admin.* kubeadm and how it is becoming a common toolkit. Similar work is ongoing to explore the idea of standardizing the description of a cluster at the infrastructure level through projects like Kubicorn. In addition, new APIs, such as the certificates API, are key building blocks for getting secure clusters up and running.\n* *Curated development experiences.* Systems like Draft help to automate the build/launch/update cycle for development workflows. Others are also exploring ways to connect developers to clusters.\n* *Making Kubernetes boring.* Kubernetes is maturing as a platform. As that happens, things in the \"nucleus\" are slowing down. In the past 6 months we've seen a concerted effort to encourage new features to be built with extensibility mechanisms as much as possible. This allows those projects to move fast while enabling exploration of the problem space.\n* *Conformance.* Another key enabler for widespread Kubernetes adoption is conformance. There has been a wide set of folks involved in describing what should get to be called \"Kubernetes\". Tools like Sonobuoy point the direction to making this be an automated process that anyone can run against any cluster.\n* *Observability.* Prometheus continues to be the go-to OSS solution for monitoring in the Kubernetes world. In additions, systems like linkerd and Istio/envoy enable introspection at the microservice mesh level.\n\nWe still have many challenges. Many of these are going to take long concerted efforts to fix. We are trapped, in some ways, by our promise of backward compatibility. It is often better to live with something annoying than to force breaking changes on our user base.\n\n*Call to action:* Great job community! But the job isn't done.

This provides better utilization of resources and enables our service developers to write serverless functions with simple declarations.\nKubernetes provides Jobs and Deployments as design constructs to handle such needs, while other frameworks like IronIO Functions, Fabric8, et al aim to solve end-to-end use case .

A developer 'writes' a function supporting common EAI patterns for start time parameterized variables, and defines it's packaging and scheduling using a yaml file. The framework then packages it as a Container alongwith an 'observer' container in a pod, 'registers' it with the scheduler while ensuring choice of 'warm' vs on-demand requisite replicas of the pod, and then through a 'Scalar' manages the execution and life cycle of job, while logging and tracing failures/success.\nThis framework is in use over months in VMware Cloud services and we are now open sourcing it.\n\nAbout Kumar Gaurav\nKumar Gaurav is working on the first set of services under VMware Cloud Services umbrella, a SaaS offering.

These applications are distributed by nature, and therefore hard to debug.\n\nMicroservice engineers debug their applications by printing values of select variables into log files. This leaves them with the daunting task of sorting through reams of log data, which at best provide a partial view of the state of application. This approach is cumbersome, time consuming and works better with \"easy\" bugs.\n\nMany advanced tools to debug monolitic applications exist in the market, and provide users with powerful ways to dissect their programs and to interact with them on the fly. However, these tools cannot be used directly for debugging applications that follow the microservice architecture pattern.\n\nSquash is designed to bring the strength of modern debuggers and the convenience of their IDEs to microservices developers. Squash uses popular, powerful and mature debuggers (gdb, dlv, java debugging) and integrates them seamlessly with Kubernetes. This allows devs to use the debugger of their choice, and the IDEs that support it, to develop microservices on any platform.\n\nAbout Idit Levine\nFounder, solo.io\nIdit Levine is a leader and innovator in the Cloud open source community, and the founder of solo.io.

With so many different components working together it can be hard to know how the pieces work together or where new products and features fit in. I will start at the highest level and then peel off the layers one at time to explain how some of the \"magic\" happens. Over the course of the presentation I will break Kubernetes into the following layers:\n\n\"Kubernetes for the End User\": A quick summary on some of the core components of Kubernetes: Namespaces, Deployments, Pods, Services, and Ingress Rules. At this layer the user just needs to understand the promises made by Kubernetes, not necessarily the way it keeps them. This layer primarily serves to establish a typical cluster workload. The resources defined here will be used when explaining all of the deeper layers.\n\n\"Kubernetes for the Cluster Admin\": This Layer peels away some of the cluster \"Magic\". I will cover how the service account, default tokens, ReplicaSet and Pods from the previous layer got created by the kube-controller-manager. I will also explain how the kube-scheduler decided which node the workload should run on and how that decision could have been influenced by fields in the pod spec. This section will touch on the core concepts of Ingress controllers, Admission Controllers, scheduling, and core controller loops. \n\n\"Kubernetes for the Cloud Admin\": This layer covers Kubernetes at an infrastructure level. Core concepts covered are: Horizontal Scaling, Load Balancing, high availability for masters and nodes, node management, and fault-tolerance levels. Here is also where I set the stage for the network layer that is covered next.\n\n\"Kubernetes for the Network Admin\": Now we dig deeper into the network infrastructure. Explaining how pods and services work together, how your network traffic figures out where to go, and how it gets there. This section covers the concepts of East-West and North-South load balancing. The goal is to provide an basic understanding of the network promises made by Kubernetes and how you might replace them with other software and services.\n\n\"Kubernetes for the Linux Admin\": A discussion of Kubernetes at the OS layer. This layer digs into the processes and configuration of the base OS. This includes pluggable container engines ex: Docker vs. Rkt, logging, CNI, metric gathering and volume mounting.\n\n\"Kubernetes for the Power-User\": Time permitting, the final section will put all of the previous ones together to show how a next-generation application might be deployed on top of Kubernetes and take advantage of the more advanced features.\n\nAbout Carson Anderson\nI've been working as a Sys Admin 8 years.

Eight months later, a small team of three operations engineers had migrated our first microservice from Mesos to Kubernetes. All without developers making any code changes. This was possible by architecting our applications with the proper set of abstractions. Fast-forward three months later and we have almost 20 microservices running on Kubernetes in production.\n\nIn this session, we’ll do a live demo of migrating a service from Mesos to Kubernetes, just like how we did it at Hootsuite! We will cover why architecting your infrastructure with the “right” abstractions helps you do these huge migrations with ease and how Kubernetes already contains these abstractions. We will explore how having a service mesh helps routing between two platforms while doing the migration. Also, how a mature CI/CD pipeline can help you deploy to two platforms with ease.

We encountered significant challenges in our transition to a microservice-based architecture. Each new service increased the operations burden to provision and maintain a growing fleet of servers, frequently slowing the process of adding new services and scaling existing services in our datacenters. \n\nI’ll discuss how we used Kubernetes to containerize our microservice ecosystem and solve those challenges. To effectively work with ephemeral Kubernetes pods, we replaced Graphite with Prometheus and Sensu with AlertManager to monitor service health rather than individual instances. We discovered massive performance issues containerizing our Java services and worked around JVM complexities. To ease our transition from virtualization to containerization, services running inside and outside of Kubernetes must seamlessly discover each other with Consul and communicate with each other.

Traditionally, the uncertainty of SPIs (they can be terminated at any time due to price fluctuations) have made managing them tricky, and restricted them to specific workloads and use cases. \n\nKubernetes, in contrast, not only handles node failure very well, it has trained developers and architects to design applications to tolerate and even embrace failure. The prospect of Kubernetes abstracting the complexities of SPIs is now a reality, enabling applications to take advantage of low-cost compute across different clouds and possibly vendors. \n\nThe purpose of this talk is to educate the audience on strategies for making the most out of this powerful combination. Specifically, we will discuss these topics:\n\n1. What are spot bidding strategies, and what is their cost vs. predictability trade-off?\n2. What class of Kubernetes applications would benefit the most from SPIs?\n3. Available Kubernetes mechanisms (e.g taints/tolerations, affinity, availability zones) for placing applications based on their tolerance with SPIs\n3. Implementation strategies (e.g. blending multiple autoscaling groups to satisfy both SPI-optimized applications vs. applications that are more mission-critical or stateful)\n4. What out-of-the box solutions exist, either free or commercial?\n5. How to take abstract away clouds from different regions and vendors, allowing workloads to always take advantage of the best available pricing?\n\nThe talk concludes with real-world test results involving multiple use cases and configurations, giving the audience an idea of the potential cost savings and trade-offs (if any) of combining Kubernetes and SPIs.\n\nAbout Bich Le\nChief Architect, Platform9\nCo-founder of Platform9 and veteran of VMware.

Given a highly salable and distributed microservices deployment is going to face failures at different layers, how do we make these microservices resilient and fault tolerant? How do we enforce policy decisions such as fine-grained access control and rate limits? How do we enabled timeouts/retries, health checks etc? Even though some language specific frameworks address these issues, the implementation is often framework or language specific. \n\nIf the underlying framework or language changes, the resiliency features need to be reimplemented or ported over. And in some cases, applications also have the responsibility of implementing the code and configuration required for resiliency and fault tolerance. A Service-mesh architecture attempts to solve these issues by extracting the common resiliency features needed by a microservice framework away from the applications and frameworks and into the platform itself.

Without having an approximate view of the remaining capacity in a cluster, it is hard for cluster operators to decide if and when the cluster should be provisioned with more capacity or not. In Kubernetes clusters, capacity is associated with worker nodes in terms of resources such as cpu, memory or storage. Discussing capacity in terms of individual resources may be a bit ambiguous because a Pod is the smallest schedulable unit in Kubernetes clusters. Therefore, cluster operators may be more interested in knowing an approximate number of pods of a specific size (amount of resources) that can be scheduled on a cluster. This talk will introduce a new tool, called cluster capacity, that can be used to analyze the capacity of a Kubernetes cluster in this way. First, the talk will discuss about its use cases, followed by its design and implementation as a scheduling simulator.

We can create a copy of our entire stack in a variety of cloud environments in about an hour. Twelve months ago, Algorithmia was limited to AWS and reliant on an enterprise product for deployment management. In that time, we learned how to ensure a highly-available setup in multiple environments, handled networking issues between old applications and pod-based applications, discovered many quirks with cloud components (such as AWS ELB), learned what wrong assumptions we held about the cloud, and migrated our live production services to run within Kubernetes. We also learned the limits of Kubernetes and when to control components on our own. Ultimately, we reduced the number of servers needed to run our full stack, simplified the process of adding services, reduced dependency on particular cloud services, and have a hardened way to deploy our platform.\n\nIn this talk I’ll cover why we moved to Kubernetes to build our enterprise product, the benefits it entailed, difficulties we encountered with Kubernetes, containers, cloud providers, and what we’re most excited about in the future of Kubernetes.\n\nAbout Patrick McQuighan\nI joined Algorithmia in December 2015 and have been improving system performance and creating the Algorithmia Enterprise product.

But most applications require more than just forwarding, various applications require different parsing patterns, outputs, formats etc. Managing these in a large multi tenant cluster can be challenging and usually require an additional shared forwarding/parsing infrastructure. Otherwise manual configuration changes by a cluster operator are needed. Both ways can be problematic when many different teams share the same cluster.\n\nIn this Lighting Talk attendees will learn how to leverage the tools to automatically load specifications/grok patterns from kubernetes at runtime. This leads developers to define those on their own in their pod definition without the existence of a cluster operator or an extra infrastructure. Because of this new possibility the developer gains more flexibility in his application without the necessity to coordinate with cluster operators or other teams.\n\nAbout Jakob Karalus\nJakob is a IT-Consultant at codecentric focussing on DevOps.

Quay now delivers a first-of-its-kind Kubernetes Application Registry that with this release is also integrated with Kubernetes Helm so that deployment of an application can be completely automated.\n\nOver the past few months, the Quay team has been laying the foundation for the first Kubernetes Application Registry. On the server side, we’ve added an experimental registry API to Quay and a minimal UI enabling the storage, discovery, and management of complete applications. On the client side, we’ve created a registry plugin for Helm, the Kubernetes package manager, that brings all of these features to the ecosystem of Helm applications, known as Charts. One of the most interesting new features introduced to both Quay and Helm is the concept of customizable release channels, much like how CoreOS ships Alpha, Beta, and Stable channels for Container Linux releases. All of this is done through a community-driven API specification, called App Registry, that enables Kubernetes ecosystem to develop more sophisticated tools and more reliable deployment pipelines. This ultimately delivers a Kubernetes Application Registry.\n\nJoin Brandon Philips to learn about CoreOS Quay and how it works to store containers and applications for Kubernetes, and get involved.\n\nAbout Brandon Philips\nBrandon Philips is helping to build modern Linux server infrastructure at CoreOS as CTO.

Kubernetes is all about letting you choose the container runtime, the operating system, the environment (cloud vs bare metal) etc., so why wouldn’t you like to choose CPU architecture as well? \n\nThe talk demonstrates Kubernetes’ multi-architecture features in a very practical manner: by having a 10-node cluster of credit-card-sized devices with three architectures (amd64, arm and arm64) in front of the audience. The cluster is deployed with kubeadm. For the demo, a cross-platform nginx workload will be created from the dashboard, deployed to all nodes regardless of architecture, monitored via an auto-updating grafana dashboard and autoscaled by a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler while traffic is generated against the cluster’s Ingress controller. And just to make things more exciting, a node’s power cable may be unplugged by a volunteer from the audience, at any time during the heavy traffic to demonstrate Kubernetes’ auto-healing functions.\n\nAbout Lucas Käldström\nHi there and thanks for finding my talk!\nI'm a Swedish-speaking Upper Secondary School Student from Finland.\n\nI'm really excited about Kubernetes and new emerging technologies.\nI have been engaged in Kubernetes for about two years now and ported Kubernetes to ARM, both 32 and 64-bit as my first larger contribution.

Devnet consists of technology innovations, software platforms, and tools needed to reach the full promise of the Software-Driven Enterprise. Our goal is to build the community of enterprise developers and innovators using DevNet’s key principles: Learn, Code, Inspire, and Connect. \n\nDevNet offers multiple services to developers. Content and API navigation via our developer-friendly portal, tailored learning labs that bring Cisco technologies and knowledge home for the developers, sandboxes that enable developers to interact with Cisco products and services in easy and cost effective ways and communities of interest that bring developers together around their main areas of interests.\n\nDevnet has been very successful and as a result, the architecture of the platform coupled with the software transformation that is occurring resulted in the cloudification of the devnet platform. At the core of the cloudification effort is the need to independently scale up the services to accommodate the growing pool of DevNet developers and to rapidly add more services to keep developers engaged and satisfied. Meeting these requirements in an architecture made of multiple monolithic services is expensive and slow. It was time to embark on our journey to transform our offerings into micro services.\n\nGoals of the project:\n- Create a high quality developer experience (learn, code, inspire, connect). This is the vision that we needed to set across the Devnet team, Cisco, and our external partners. Setting this vision and getting buy in across all levels of the organization is key.\n- Create a flexible and agile platform. With a clear vision and alignment, the next set is to execute on the new architecture and enable the flexibility and scalability requirements.\n- Make sure that our investment and resources are building and strengthening the platform. To accomplish this goal, we had to address process issues and invest in the right resources. This is critical to understand at the beginning of the effort and to plan to address and track progress against this important goal.\n- BU content onboarding as strategic and technical advantage. Since the hard work was accomplished in the first 3 goals, this fourth one was achieved as a matter of addressing these Bus early and getting not only their buyin but more importantly, co-development alignment.\n\nThis presentation will discuss the effort we completed in taking Devnet to production with Kubernetes, Prometheus, and monitoring enhancements required.

(Through the definition of network policies).\nThis model fully abstracts the pod network information (IP/Port) from the pod's identity (pod's labels). \n\nWith the traditional approach, the NetworkPolicies are implemented by the Kubernetes networking backend (Flannel, Calico, ...) that translates the policies into a set of IPs/Ports that need to be constantly updated.\n\nHowever, another approach is possible by using the labels associated with each pods directly as metadata on the networking stack (transparently from the networking backend). NetworkPolicies then become a simple API-level authentication scheme that is completely independent from the network backend.\n\nThis talk will go over the pros and cons of each model, describing specific use-cases where it makes sense to use the one or the other.\n\nIt will introduce a new way of implementing those NetworkPolicies that doesn't rely at all on network primitives, but only on the set of labels associated to each pod.\n\nNetworking should be used for reachability between cluster nodes. \nbut security and network policies should not always be tied to your networking.\n\nAbout Bernard Van De Walle\nWorking initially on massive production core/edge network routers, I saw the evolution of networking and security from fully physical to the new models emerging today: SDN, virtual networks and massive scaling for micro-services.

Some want to increase utilization, thus they want to pack Pods as densely as possible. Other want to maximize reliability, so they spread the Pods as thinly as they can. \n\nAnother one may have Pods that interfere with each other, e.g. by writing a lot to a local disk and don't want to put those on a single Node.\n\nDuring this talk I'll tell what features are present in the default Kubernetes scheduler that can help you to accomplish all those things and more.\n\nMarek Grabowski\nMarek is a Software Engineer working on Google’s Technical Infrastructure since 2013.

With the rise of single-page apps, gathering metrics from within the browser has never been more important - latency as experienced by the user is much more important than any measurements taken from individual backend services. And if you can’t track Javascript errors that could potentially lead to blank screens, you should feel bad. \n\nThis talk presents a method for tracking UI metrics and errors with Prometheus. By getting this data into Prometheus, you can reuse the dashboarding and alerting options that you've grown to love.

One challenge with DNS-based service discovery though is the unreliable nature of the UDP protocol used by DNS. There is no guarantee of the delivery for the query and response of service records. In this discussion, we provide a mechanism of CoreDNS over gRPC to address the reliability issue of DNS-based service discovery. As a flexible DNS server, CoreDNS is capable of transport over multiple protocols besides traditional UDP. With DNS over gRPC for inter-node communication and normal UDP for local-node DNS serving, we are able to achieve the much-needed reliability while maintaining the easy-to-use DNS front end for service discovery in Kubernetes clusters. \n\nTo Learn More:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd6T2ZEy6y4","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xd6T2ZEy6y4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrVG","projects":["Kubernetes","CoreDNS","gRPC"],"speakers":[{"name":"Yong Tang","role":"Director of Engineering, MobileIron","bio":"Yong Tang is the director of engineering at MobileIron.

The conventional wisdom claims that Metrics, Logging and Tracing are “the three pillars” of observability… yet software organizations check these three boxes and are still grasping at straws during emergencies.  In this session we’ll illustrate the problem with the three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces are just data – they are the fuel, not the car. We then reframe observability around two fundamental activities: (1) measurement and (2) explanation.  “Measurement” must be both robust and precise; “explanation” must present the larger context of distributed transactions and the role that contention plays under peak load. We present both via demos and examples to ground the session in real-world storytelling. \n\nTo Learn More:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJV_CgiqlOE","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EJV_CgiqlOE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrXI","projects":["LightStep"],"speakers":[{"name":"Ben Sigelman","role":"Co-founder and CEO, LightStep","bio":"Ben Sigelman is a co-founder and the CEO at LightStep, a co-creator of Dapper (Google’s distributed tracing system), and co-creator of the OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry projects (both part of the CNCF).

Kautz IV, Red Hat \n\nNetwork Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel approach solving L2/L3 network use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio, Network Service Mesh maps the concept of a service mesh to L2/L3 payloads. Network Service Mesh enables a variety of types of Use Cases such as: * Connecting Pods to: -VPN Gateways -Non-Kubernetes virtual bridge domains -The *right* physical NIC or SR-IOV VF for their needs -Multiple-interfaces * Cloud-native NFV use cases Network Service Mesh controls the L2/L3 data planes to deliver these types of use cases. Network Service Mesh enables users to express the context of their network needs in a Cloud Native manner, rather than manually stringing together disjoint interfaces, IPAM, and subnets. Finally, we discuss how audience members can get involved and help drive the direction and development of NSM. \n\nTo Learn More:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeAKtUFaqQ0","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YeAKtUFaqQ0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/Grbq","projects":["SPIRE","Network Service Mesh","Kubernetes","Istio"],"speakers":[{"name":"Frederick Kautz","role":"Head of Edge Infrastructure, Doc.ai","bio":"Frederick Kautz is Head of Edge Infrastructure at Doc.ai.

Audit logs can tell us what happened in our clusters, when it happened, who did it, what resources were affected, and more. The problem is, even a fairly stagnant Kubernetes cluster generates millions of audit logs per week. And it's up to us to distill value out of what is largely just noise.   So, how can we isolate important audit events to better understand what's going on in our clusters?  In this session, we'll first go over what Kubernetes audit logs are and what information they provide. We'll then do a live a demo of getting audit set up on a cluster, and inspect the raw logs that are generated. And finally, we'll talk about strategies for pulling useful information out of the deluge, so we can make sense of these millions of audit logs glean actionable insights. \n\nTo Learn More:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dJiagat4FI","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7dJiagat4FI/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrX9","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Kate Kuchin","role":"Senior Systems Software Engineer, Heptio","bio":"Kate is a Senior Software Engineer at Heptio, where she works on the UX team to build tools to make Kubernetes easier to adopt and use.

This means that the infrastructure reliability and tooling that may typically be available are not. In addition, as a small team managing clusters in several isolated datacenters around the world, achieving commonality is challenging. While we started using container orchestration because we wanted to increase resource utilisation and deployment agility, we have found the real value has been in our ability to abstract many of the differences between clusters. Now, as we move towards Kubernetes, we will share lessons for shifting developers between different container orchestrators as seamlessly as possible by using Spinnaker as a common continuous deployment tool. \n\nTo Learn More:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9BbPkwxmik","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h9BbPkwxmik/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrRj","projects":["sso","Kubernetes","Spinnaker"],"speakers":[{"name":"Jamie Hewland","role":"Site Reliability Engineer, Praekelt.org","bio":"Jamie is a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at Praekelt.org, a non-profit organisation that builds health and youth-related services that aim to improve the wellbeing of millions of people around the world.

Beyond the core of container orchestration, there are abstractions for load balancers, persistent storage and autoscaling, to name a few. With this in mind, when Manifold set out to switch cloud providers, we decided to do so by first using as many abstractions in the Kubernetes ecosystem as possible. In this talk, we will explore how Manifold used Kubernetes to migrate between cloud providers. We will look at how to identify cloud specific services and APIs in use in your application, and how Manifold evaluated whether to uplift to a Kubernetes abstraction, translate to the other cloud provider’s service, or keep as is.

The project has 8 repositories on GIT and has hundreds of contributors actively working on its repos on daily basis, which makes productivity super critical so that every contributor’s time is well spent and quality of code is ensured. This talk gives an overview of how contributor productivity is achieved for Knative from 4 dimensions: test health, release health, metrics, and performance. We will go over test infrastructures in place to show how it makes writing and running tests is an easy and pleasant experience for contributors.

We demonstrate how latency-based autoscaling outperforms CPU- and memory-based autoscaling under a variety of conditions including live traffic from the attendees of this talk, and suggest ways to safely apply this technique to existing systems. \n\nTo Learn More:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSiGFH4ZnS8","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gSiGFH4ZnS8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrR6","projects":["Kubernetes","Linkerd","Prometheus"],"speakers":[{"name":"Thomas Rampelberg","role":"Software Engineer, Buoyant","bio":"Thomas Rampelberg is a Software Engineer at Buoyant Inc.

In the modern application architecture, decentralization of data management results in the data being distributed over a vast surface area across different data stores and locations. At the same time, sensitive data needs to be controlled and protected for compliance with data security and privacy regulations such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.   The service mesh (Istio/Envoy) provides universal observability across the infrastructure.

This talk illustrates the process by walking through the discovery, patching, and disclosure of CVE-2017-1002101. In Nov 2017, we received a report about how misusing the volume subpath feature could result in access to host files. A team was assembled to investigate the vulnerability, develop a patch, and release it to all supported versions of Kubernetes -- ALL in secret. As we walk through the story from discovery to disclosure, we will also deep dive into the technical details of how this feature allowed a container to escape to the host filesystem, and how it was fixed. You will walk away with techniques for secure file handling in multi-tenant environments, best practices for restricting volume access in your Kubernetes clusters, and an understanding of how a large open source project manages security issues. \n\nTo Learn More:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8hQ4WFd75U","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o8hQ4WFd75U/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrZc","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Michelle Au","role":"Software Engineer, Google","bio":"Michelle Au is a software engineer at Google and is a Kubernetes SIG Storage maintainer.

Well, not quite: there are still some important unknowns to understand before your service will be ready for production. It's still unclear how the new service behaves when it's being pushed, and it's possible that K8s will kill the service before serving a single request. At Buffer, we've developed a technique to optimize K8s deployment limits using load testing to identify optimal resource limits. When the service is under heavy load there are a few key metrics to watch to identify bottlenecks. These key metrics can be used to adjust resource limits. This approach allowed us to safely and efficiently switch over more than half our production traffic to our K8s cluster and can be applied to any application.

Many clusters may implement a multi-master setup, but often this is not enough to consider a cluster highly available.   So how can you truly achieve a highly available, highly reliable, and multi-master kubernetes cluster? In this talk, we will cover exactly that. The audience will walk away with a solid understanding of what HA is, what failure domains should be considered based on their level of risk tolerance, and actionable knowledge that they can implement in their own organizations.

This presentation will discuss how Kolide has approached the problem of application tenancy by building a Kubernetes Operator to manage the complete lifecycle of each tenant as an isolated instance of a single-tenant application. We will analyze strategies for account management, observability, deployments, networking, and security.

Kubernetes is becoming the standard platform for deploying applications in the enterprise. The Helm project provides tooling for packaging and an extensive catalog of ready to run applications. However, deploying applications in production requires much more: monitoring, logging, certificate management and so on. The community has adopted a de-facto ‘production stack’ that includes popular projects such as Prometheus, Vault, ElasticSearch, Fluentd and others. Unfortunately, putting together this basic plumbing is not standardized, and results in a lot of wasted, duplicated efforts.

These include parts of our trading system and our document translation system, build and test farms, and artifact caches.  Kubernetes doesn't provide full tenant isolation so users often create per-tenant clusters. Two Sigma has many teams with unique data and service access needs, so such a model would have large overheads. We built multi-tenant clusters by coupling namespace, RBAC and PSPs with Two Sigma’s entitlement system.

We discuss testing against trace data rather than code, and how this technique opens the door to an entire suite of verification practices which are difficult to achieve with the current unit/integration test dichotomy.   We show that Trace Tests can span across multiple network calls, languages, and services, while still retaining unit-test-like ability to observe fine grained internal behavior. This combination is particularly useful in mircoservice and serverless environments.  In addition, Trace Testing ensure that behavior which is important enough to test in development is also observable in production.  We also propose that formal proof logic – which can catch new classes of bugs and help with live debugging – is not nearly as complicated once you have distributed tracing. \n\nTo learn more:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU-fTr-udZg","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NU-fTr-udZg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrRF","projects":["Serverless","LightStep"],"speakers":[{"name":"Ted Young","role":"Director of Open Source Development, LightStep","bio":"Ted Young is the Director of Open Source Development at LightStep, and one of the core maintainers of the OpenTracing project.

To achieve high availability for your applications, there's a lot more involved.

We used to have a single place like an IDE of choice to add some breakpoints, step through the code, and hopefully solve the issue.  In a distributed world where there are many moving parts that can’t always be run on a single machine, debugging an application consisting of multiple services has become significantly harder with microservices written in a variety of languages that come with their own toolchain spread across multiple teams and repositories.

Game Servers are neither stateless (no Deployments), or ordered stateful (no StatefulSets) - but sit somewhere in between the two. They require direct connections (no load balancers), and can’t be turned off once players are connected to them (no traditional autoscalers).

While Kubernetes excels in automated application management, more often than not, the state of these applications live outside of Kubernetes. What happens when users develop complex stateful software but still want to benefit from the automation and portability that Kubernetes provides?\n\nIn this talk, Celina and Matt share their experience creating an operator for a unique stateful workload: a sharded, replicated, multi-zone time-series database. They discuss the major shift in thought -- from the mental model of a 1:1 process/node relationship, to one far more adaptive to both machine and user behavior.\n\nThe audience will walk away with a framework for expressing their stateful workloads using Kubernetes primitives, and advice for navigating the difficult process of codifying innovative abstract ideas without over-engineering solutions. \n\nTo learn more:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFm5KaTaOk","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aDFm5KaTaOk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/Gsxn","projects":["Kubernetes","Ship"],"speakers":[{"name":"Matt Schallert","role":"Site Reliability Engineer, Uber","bio":"Matt is a Site Reliability Engineer at Uber where he works on their open-source metrics platform, M3.

Accelerate Your Prometheus Dashboard Using Trickster - Shilla Saebi & James Ranson, Comcast \n\nWe live in a world where high performance and speed are essential. A few extra seconds of response time on a dashboard can be a deal breaker. Many dashboards request the entire time range of data from the time series database, every time a dashboard loads or reloads. This can result in slower rendering times, and different results depending on when the request is made. We are proud to announce that Trickster, a new open source project, was developed to address this very issue. Written in Go, Trickster is a reverse proxy cache for the Prometheus HTTP APIv1 that considerably accelerates dashboard rendering times for any series queried from Prometheus. This is possible because of the delta proxy, step boundary normalization, and fast forward features. In the presentation, we will discuss how Trickster was developed at Comcast, and we will show you a live demo of the software. \n\nTo learn more:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO7nrX20iT0","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZO7nrX20iT0/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrZ2","projects":["Board","Prometheus","Trickster"],"speakers":[{"name":"James Ranson","role":"Principal Software Architect, Comcast","bio":"James Ranson is a Platform Software Architect currently living in Denver Colorado.

Network Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel approach solving complicated L2/L3 use cases in Kubernetes that are tricky to address with the existing Kubernetes Network Model. Inspired by Istio, Network Service Mesh maps the concept of a service mesh to L2/L3 payloads. The NSM architecture can be naturally extended to allow interaction of the NSM with the physical network enabling cloud providers to offer value-add services like: Connecting a customers Pod(s) to a network egress specific to that customer Introspecting the Network Service Mesh control messaging to adapt the physical network to serve customer needs better. Allowing customers to request specific physical network services. The NSM community has developed several design patterns for solving problems in K8s that may be of utility to others working in other problem domains in K8s.

We'll share with you our evaluation rubric and production readiness checklist which will hopefully aid you on your journey to better service-to-service communication. \n\nTo learn more:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym095HaTkIo","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ym095HaTkIo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/Grag","projects":[],"speakers":[{"name":"Austin Adams","role":"Software Development Manager, Ygrene Energy Fund","bio":"Austin Adams is a passionately curious technologist who is people oriented, fast learning and excited to challenge tough problems with modern solutions.

Thanks to extensibility of Kubernetes, it is possible to build custom advanced deployment strategies while reusing Kubernetes core concepts.

Hundreds of databases running on more than a thousand EC2 instances were managed by just one person, and developers were getting fed up and began to migrate to other higher performance but non-relational datastores. We surveyed the landscape and decided to address these challenges by adopting Vitess and Kubernetes. This talk will detail our journey towards MySQL cloud-native nirvana. We'll cover lessons learned, bugs squashed, and tools built -- including the design and operation of our very own Kubernetes operator for Vitess.

Distributed deployments across heterogeneous infrastructure are increasingly common for cloud native applications. The working group sees common need patterns in cloud-native application architecture to improve the security of the systems. Without common ways to programatically ensure consistent policy, it is increasingly difficult to evaluate system architecture security at scale. We propose that the creation of open source libraries that enable interoperability across software and providers will enable the adoption of common protocols for access control.

New vendors providing support for Kubernetes should feel equally empowered to do so as any of today’s existing cloud providers. More importantly, SIG Cloud Provider is focused on ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience across providers. The SIG acts as a central group for developing the Kubernetes project in a way that ensures all providers share common privileges and responsibilities. As Kubernetes transitions from building all binaries necessary to create and run a Kubernetes cluster, to a new world in which Cloud Providers must supply some additional artifacts (Cloud Controller Manager, e.g.) to most effectively run, one area of concern is around how to manage the build and release process effectively. This deep dive session will be a working session to brainstorm how to manage this effectively. Questions for consideration include: - whether and how to include Cloud Provider e2e tests in the suite of release blocking tests for OSS Kubernetes - how to communicate to end users whether they need and how to obtain additional artifacts - how to manage optional addons and extensions in the validation of Kubernetes (e.g., CoreDNS on Kubernetes on N Cloud Providers), when those ecosystem projects evolve on their own release schedules.

The solution supports millions of persistent, concurrent connections; enables tens of thousands of messages per second; is globally addressable; stores millions of states; and responds with minimal latency (&lt;250ms). To evaluate build approaches, the team split into Makers & Breakers. Makers developed the solution stack while Breakers focused on repurposing Locust, a high-scale load testing framework, to simulate behavior.

We introduce NeZha and explain how it improves Kubeflow’s training. Nezha is an open source, community driven, and highly collaborative project, contributed by storage and big data engineers. Nezha is based on Kubernetes Initializer: it rewrites Pod spec, adds a sidecar S3 cache, and redirects Pod to use local cache to accelerate.  Nezha is self contained and easy to use. It does not require modification to existing applications or user visible Pod changes.   Nezha improves big data application performance.

We’ll also show how we use admission controllers to enforce naming conventions and security constraints such as container image source on API objects submitted to a cluster. \n\nTo learn more:","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Seattle '18: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUuuEjbaqVs","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUuuEjbaqVs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/GrUC","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Davi Arnaut","role":"Site Reliability Engineer, Airbnb","bio":"Davi Arnaut is a member of the SRE team and works on supporting the Kubernetes initiatives at Airbnb."},{"name":"Stephen Chan","role":"Software Engineer, Airbnb","bio":"Stephen has worked on Airbnb during much of its Kubernetes migration, from the first production service to hundreds of services running across many clusters and different environments.

For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting the Container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs. When a Container is starting, the kubelet has no way to tell whether the startup is deadlocked or just taking longer than expected. This is problematic when deploying Java based application servers which can take several minutes to start. In this presentation, Matthias Bertschy will show you what are the risks of misconfigured probes, how to circumvent them and a possible solution to be implemented in the Kubernetes API.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO1uy9QKNHQ","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wO1uy9QKNHQ/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MPgZ","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Matthias Bertschy","role":"Lead DevOps Engineer, Swissquote Bank","bio":"Matthias Bertschy is a Lead DevOps Engineer at Swissquote Bank.

Our microservices should be as close to pure business logic as possible, but what happens when we add so many services that our network requests are dramatically slowing the application down? The natural result is to look for some caching of requests on either the client or service side. Enter Redis, Memcached, and other caching tools all to help reduce network calls and overall latency. All of this comes with implementation penalty reducing the purity of our services.

Some specific use cases we’ll discuss include misuse of configmaps to hold sensitive data, overly loose permissions on pods/services, and abuse of cluster role bindings that grant too many (or the wrong) permissions.

Enter SPIFFE (Secure Production Infrastructure for Everyone) and which builds on designs first championed at Google, Twitter and elsewhere to provide robust authentication and trust between disparate micro-services. SPIFFE and SPIRE make it trivial to establish trust between workloads that may be elastically scaled and dynamically scheduled, and deployed in deeply heterogeneous environments. We'll walk through the design goals for SPIFFE (a specification) and SPIRE (a multi-cloud implementation of SPIFFE).

In this talk, we will cover the basics of eBPF and then dive into a hands-on exploration of use cases where eBPF-based technologies like Cilium and BCC can enable security visibility and isolation well beyond what is possible with traditional Linux security primitives, Examples include: 1. Auditing the set of syscalls made by users who access pods via \"kubectl exec\".  2. Network visibility and access control that distinguishes between a sidecar and primary container inside a single pod.  3.

Using a repeatable build process maximizes container layer caching and takes advantage of Kubernetes built in pod template hashing. With this caching in place, it becomes feasible to deploy all services in a large repo reliably without under-deploying -- not deploying changed components, leaving them unvalidated on master -- or over-deploying, waiting for a potentially expensive rollout despite not having made changes.

Since Envoy is written in C++, the primary way to introduce new extended functionality in Envoy is by writing an extension (e.g. filters, either network or HTTP filter, as one of the most relevant use-cases in Envoy), in C++. It is also possible to write an extension for Envoy using Lua, but the current scope of this extension is only for HTTP traffic.

We realized this mix of standard and optional services could quickly get out of control and needed normalization. In early 2018, we exposed application teams to Kubernetes manifests; they were excited about control over deployments, but unprepared for the complexity.

In 2019 Apply received its first major architectural overhaul, addressing long standing issues and bringing a cornucopia of new functionality to users and platform developers. Phillip Wittrock and Jenny Buckley will review both the changes in architecture and the new functionality that will usher in a delivery renaissance for Kubernetes.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DWWlcDUxtA","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1DWWlcDUxtA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MPZ1","projects":["Kubernetes","Architect"],"speakers":[{"name":"Jennifer Buckley","role":"Software Engineer, Google","bio":"Jennifer Buckley is a Software Engineer at Google, a member of Kubernetes SIG API Machinery, and a member of the Apply Working Group, which is focused on redesigning Kubectl Apply.

There are solutions to pilot canary testing from outside Kubernetes. How about driving it from inside Kubernetes instead? Kanary is a new Operator proposing an easy, automated and integrated way to orchestrate the canary testing phase, while controlling the traffic, the validation, and the rollout of a new version.

OPA is typically used as a service to enforce authorization policy in a cluster. New configurations submitted to an API are filtered through OPA and accepted or rejected depending on the defined policy. But some types of policy violations can be caught even earlier in the development process.

First I will start by separating three layers: 1) consuming block and file storage from a pod running in Kubernetes, 2) deploying a stateful app (like a database) on Kubernetes using storage and workload primitives, and 3) deploying a software defined storage system on top of Kubernetes to provide block or file storage. Each of these areas has a different set of challenges that are often conflated to make storage on Kubernetes appear much harder than it is.\n\nAfter separating these layers, I will help you understand what the challenges are with each of them, and how you work around them to effectively deploy stateful applications on Kubernetes.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=169w6QlWhmo","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/169w6QlWhmo/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MQhi","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Saad Ali","role":"Staff Software Engineer, Google","bio":"Saad Ali is a Staff Software Engineer at Google and member of the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee.

Accidentally. Twice. With little to no user impact. David shares how they recovered and learned to operate many clusters automatically and safely.\n\nIn 2017, Spotify planned the migration of hundreds of teams, thousands of services, and tens of thousands of hosts to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). In the last half of 2018, Spotify migrated 50 teams and hundreds of services, including critical ones, onto multiple production clusters.\n\nDavid describes what led to the cluster deletions and how they barely affected users. Since the postmortem, Spotify has minimized downtime and human error by declaratively defining clusters in code with Terraform, backing up and restoring clusters with Ark, and increasing scalability and availability by running many more clusters.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix0Tw8uinWs","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ix0Tw8uinWs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MQbb","projects":["Terraform","Kubernetes","Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)"],"speakers":[{"name":"David Xia","role":"Infrastructure Engineer, Spotify","bio":"David Xia is an infrastructure engineer at Spotify who works on deployment tooling.

Kubernetes CSI support recently advanced to GA. In the longer term, there is a plan to deprecate existing legacy storage plugins. New storage-related functionality, such as snapshot support, is now being targeted for CSI only. The “in-tree” vSphere storage plugin remains fully supported at this time. but users running Kubernetes on vSphere may wish to change to CSI to gain new features. At some point in the future, migration to the CSI plugin will become mandatory. This session will explain and demonstrate deployment, configuration and use of the new vSphere CSI driver.

Sometimes, however, the process of finding that one piece of code in a large codebase that’s just right for your use case can feel like a scavenger hunt. But the spoils of the hunt are vast. This talk explores how the Linkerd project has leveraged the Kubernetes codebase to replace their bespoke code with existing code that's more robust and better tested. Specific examples include switching the project to use Kubernetes' shared informers for caching API responses and adding rate limiting via work queues for TLS certificate distribution.

Two open source Kubernetes operators, tf-operator and mpi-operator, will be discussed. Both operators manage training jobs for TensorFlow but they have different distribution strategies. The tf-operator fits the parameter server distribution strategy which has a centralized parameter server for coordination. The mpi-operator, on the other hand, utilize MPI allreduce primitive implementation. While the parameter server strategy requires a right ratio of CPU (for parameter servers) and GPU (for workers) to reach network-optimal, the all reduce distribution might be easier to optimize network cost. We will share our performance numbers in out talk for comparison of those two operators.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyLi1cfJeM8","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jyLi1cfJeM8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MPaT","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Yong Tang","role":"Director of Engineering, MobileIron","bio":"Yong Tang is the director of engineering at MobileIron.

Having a service mesh technology inside is even better - but there are legacy services, too. Leveraging the benefits of a service mesh is possible even without migrating all your legacy services into your kubernetes cluster - you can integrate them into the mesh.    We'll give a brief overview of the properties and benefits of service meshes in general and specifically how they are configurable in Istio. Then we'll have a look at the expansion of the mesh to services outside of kubernetes. We'll go into how the expansion is done, what needs to be done in the legacy systems and what obstacles we had to overcome.

This is disruptive to services, and expensive for long-running applications or jobs. It is very important to have the ability to scale pod resources without restarts.    In this talk, Vinay and Peng will present a design for restart-free scaling of pod resources, with container restart as a policy-controlled choice rather than a necessity. They will illustrate a customer use case, a gene-sequencing application where pod restart is expensive. They will go over the changes to Kubernetes components that made this feature possible. They will discuss how they addressed some unique challenges such as multiple scheduler race conditions, and respecting pod disruption budget if pod restart is needed. They will talk about how failures are handled via smart retries, and conclude with a demo.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eic6kBa3QAc","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eic6kBa3QAc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MPcJ","projects":["Kubernetes","Vertica"],"speakers":[{"name":"Vinay Kulkarni","role":"Sr. Architect, Futurewei","bio":"Vinay works as Senior Lead Architect, Cloud BU in the Seattle Research Center of Futurewei R&D Labs.

Kubernetes clusters that integrate with external network infrastructure (such as a cloud provider) need a way to coordinate Kubernetes Pod “readiness” with setup latencies in the network fabric. Not tackling this problem causes lost packets and dropped connections OR requires inserting worst-case delays to pod startup to account for external setup. It allows Foremast, an open source engine to maintain the health of applications running on K8s, to remediate similar problems in a much smoother way.\n\nMinhan and Ping will cover the coordination problem, how the new pod readiness gate API fixes the issue and experiences from both Google and Intuit using the API with real workloads.

While edge computing provides an u-low-latency solution, it brings with it other challenges. On one hand, edge clouds are small, and their computing resources are scarce. On the other hand, they are required to serve many applications, such as the 5G edge ecosystem, live video streaming and IoT. The edge gives the opportunity for vendors to deploy their own software. However, this needs to be done in an agile manner. With the proliferation of IoT devices and Autonomous cars of different brands, the industry cannot afford countless years and M$ integration projects.

Reducing cognitive load makes oncall more effective. When dashboards are organized hierarchically on both the service and the resource level, troubleshooting becomes an exercise of divide and conquer. The oncall person can quickly eliminate whole areas of problems and zone in on the real issue.

Rather we seek a new, evolved definition of the Kubernetes release/support cadence, an investigation in a time-limited fashion during 2019 of the questions of \"To LTS Or Not To LTS\" and \"What Are We Releasing And Why And How Is It Best Integrated, Validate, And Supported\". Discussion spans complex questions of what support is desirable and viable in the minds of users, vendors, and ecosystem code contributors. This presentation will provide an overview of first half of our 2019 survey findings, describe progress towards and future work remaining to achieve a higher level of critical API stability, and outline the shape of possible support enhancement proposals.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJhENGXNpVU","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yJhENGXNpVU/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MkJq","projects":["Kubernetes"],"speakers":[{"name":"Tim Pepper","role":"Software Engineer, VMware","bio":"Tim is a Senior Staff Engineer in VMware's Open Source Technology Center with over 20 years in open source.

Unfortunately, a nearly unlimited number of unique potential paths tends to overwhelm time series capture, making it difficult to get a clear picture of service behaviors. In this talk I’ll introduce the concept of the Service Profile, a custom Kubernetes resource used by Linkerd. The service profile lets operators define permitted routes for the service with regular expressions, which allows Prometheus to scrape and aggregate service behaviors in a manageable way.

The solution relies on a combination of an MQTT broker such as Google IoT Core together with an edge deployed registry, database and serverless functions. In this retail solution, all edge devices are managed in the cloud, while edge computing is managed through serverless functions.

How can we ensure isolation for critical systems? How can we achieve compliance with regulations like GDPR and SOX? How can we efficiently incorporate identity into unsupported legacy systems? Most importantly, how can we do all of this in a way that doesn’t get in the way of engineers?

However, a more recent onset of large-cluster use-cases highlighted some newer scalability limitations when adopting the “one big cluster” pattern.

A Tale of Cold-Start Struggles on Kubernetes - Gregory Haynes, IBM \n\nA core component of serverless platforms is scale-to-zero functionality which provides users with near 0 application cost when idle. With this comes the dreaded cold-start problem: When a user's application is not in use for an extended period an activating request can take significantly longer to complete. Knative is no different in this respect and until recently our cold-start time was measured in seconds due to the cost of Kubernetes deployments. Recently, a large effort was undertaken to improve this delay and the result is a system which scales Kubernetes deployments up from 0 in nearly a second. We will dive deep into what actually goes on inside Kubernetes when a deployment is scaled up, how we determined where time is spent, and then some of our novel techniques to drastically speed up this process.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFbh_BOGcjs","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aFbh_BOGcjs/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MPcb","projects":["Kubernetes","Rio","Serverless","Knative"],"speakers":[{"name":"Gregory Haynes","role":"Open Source Cloud Software Engineer, IBM","bio":"Greg Haynes is a Senior Software Engineer at IBM where he is focused on developing the Knative serving project.

We'll start by describing two basic approaches: deploying nodes to the Edge with a central control plane; and deploying whole clusters to the Edge. This will be followed by a deep dive into Kubernetes architectural features and constraints in the context of both approaches. We'll see which course makes the most sense for some specific use cases. Next we'll discuss some common challenges to successful deployments, such as resource limits and network availability, and provide some guidance on how to deal with them. There are opportunities to contribute to the evolution of Kubernetes to better serve edge use cases.

It features a multi-dimensional data model with a powerful query language and integrates many aspects of systems and service monitoring: from the instrumentation of services over the collection and storage of metrics data, all the way to dashboarding and alerting. Native support for various service discovery mechanisms also make it particularly suitable for dynamic cloud-based environments. In the introduction, Prometheus co-founder Julius Volz explains the architecture of Prometheus and shows its advantages over traditional monitoring systems.  For the deep dive: Join Prometheus maintainers to learn more about the design, project goals and history of Prometheus. We will cover in depth concepts of Prometheus to enable you to get a better understanding of what it is all about. The talk will cover topics including federation, relabelling and PromQL joins.

In k8s, each node effectively becomes a switch/router of the traffic passing between the PODs. Some k8s CNI plugins allow using these protocols to export traffic flow information as well. Together with good analysis tools, this can provide better visibility into the network in the cluster (both in real time and in history), which is crucial for debugging networking issues, identifying the bottlenecks, or investigation of security incidents.    In this talk, I will showcase how a powerful IPFIX collector and analyzer for k8s can be build using existing open-source tools: GoFlow and Logstash for collecting and post-processing of the flow records, Elasticsearch as the storage and search engine for the flows, and Prometheus + Kibana for easy observability of the flows.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj7pmz5sutE","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sj7pmz5sutE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MPbp","projects":["Prometheus","Elastic","Logstash"],"speakers":[{"name":"Rastislav Szabo","role":"Staff Engineer, PANTHEON.tech","bio":"Rastislav is an enthusiastic and motivated professional with more than ten years of software development experience, working on cloud-native and software-defined networking projects.

There are many ways to try and avoid these problems, but one way is to stop items getting on the release train until it's ready.    Istio does many things, but the traffic management functionality is the key to this solution. It allows traffic to be routed to different versions of the same service.

No, Really! - Phil Estes, IBM \n\nThe CRI (container runtime interface) in Kubernetes—designed to abstract the host’s runtime details from the kubelet codebase—has been around for a few years now. CRI implementations beyond the pre-existing Docker engine driver have been appearing for some time now.    As of early 2019, Docker, Virtlet, containerd, cri-o and Sylab’s Singularity project all implement the CRI! If you add in Kata containers and AWS Firecracker, the unique number of CRI combinations is growing rapidly.    How would you decide which CRI implementation is right for you?

For example, it is common for a team to own a subset of services in a namespace, yet RBAC permissions grant that team access to other pods within the namespace. We will demonstrate a number of solutions available for specific problems, such as pod network policies, the open policy agent, custom controllers that gate API functionality. We will also discuss problems with the namespace permission model, and possible alternatives. Namespaces create an arbitrary boundary around resources, which creates the need to then bridge those boundaries. We will demonstrate ideas for bridging namespace networks, and posix-style objection permissions within a namespace.","channel":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","event":"Barcelona '19: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon","videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ73EBP2a9Q","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TZ73EBP2a9Q/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"schedLink":"https://sched.co/MPdx","projects":["Kubernetes","Rio"],"speakers":[{"name":"Vallery Lancey","role":"Infrastructure Software Engineer, Lyft","bio":"Vallery Lancey is a self-described Systems Witch (more formally, an Infrastructure Software Engineer at Lyft).

Writing reliable distributed microservices is notoriously difficult, even with Kubernetes help. In the absence of a coherent and cohesive set of standard open source distributed computing primitives available across all programming languages, things get really hard. We take for granted standard primitives provided by Linux like file systems, virtual memory, threads, network sockets, and locks. Without them, modern application development would be almost impossible. Yet distributed systems require different primitives for things like consistent replication, sharding, distributed shared memory, load balancing, failure handling, and auto-scaling.

The Kubernetes has included GPU support for applications. However, there are some limitations of GPU usage:\n1. GPU assignment is exclusive. Containers cannot share GPU resources.\n2. A container can request one or more GPUs, but it is not possible to request a fraction of a GPU.\n\nThis session introduces how to run workload using the GPU in Kubernetes. In addition, an approach will be demonstrated to use virtual GPU (vGPU) technology to enable multiple pods concurrently accessing the same physical GPU.
